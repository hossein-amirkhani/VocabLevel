1
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:04,484
Okay, great. Bye.

2
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,291
Guess who's coming
to Thanksgiving dinner?

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,085
Sidney Poitier?

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:11,686
I miss Rachel.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:13,329
My parents.

6
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,848
Great, they haven't seen the place
since I moved in.

7
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:19,290
If you could not mention that
we live together, that'd be great.

8
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,688
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.

9
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,084
Why can't I tell them
we live together?

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:27,086
They don't know we're dating.
Should we eat in the kitchen?

11
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:29,092
Why haven't you told them?

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,927
Well, I was going to. I really was.

13
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:35,210
But then somewhere,
just out of nowhere, I didn't.

14
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,484
Why not? Wouldn't they be happy?

15
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:41,884
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
I'll see you then.

16
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:43,572
Why wouldn't they be happy?

17
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:45,286
Well, because. . .

18
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,281
. . .mainly. . .

19
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,291
. . .they don't like you.

20
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,842
-I'm sorry.
-What? Why? Why?

21
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,409
Maybe because you used to be aloof. . .

22
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,525
. . .or that you're sarcastic
or that you joke around. . .

23
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:01,412
. . .or that you throw your clothes
on the couch.

24
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:04,002
Is this why they don't like me
or you don't like me?

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,530
I know I should have told them.
I shouldn't care what they think.

26
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,648
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:14,729
It'll be okay because when
they come over, I will be charming.

28
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:17,441
I will make them love me,
then we'll tell them.

29
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:18,688
Will that work?

30
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:22,164
I can be pretty charming, babe.
I won you over, didn't l?

31
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,887
I don't think you'll ever get
my parents that drunk.

32
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,410
The One Where Ross Got High

33
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:32,882
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

34
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:09,206
Hey. Oh, good, Ross.
Your parents like me, right?

35
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,284
Yes, of course they like you.

36
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:12,932
Monica told me they don't.

37
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,725
Yeah, they don't like you.

38
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:16,922
Do you know why?

39
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:21,007
Maybe it's because you're sarcastic
or maybe it's because you--

40
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,886
If people don't know,
they shouldn't just guess!

41
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,532
Another Thanksgiving
with nothing to give thanks for.

42
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,486
Maybe I give thanks
for you shutting up, huh?

43
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:34,726
Maybe I give thanks by taking
my PlayStation to my place.

44
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,685
Maybe I love you.

45
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,886
Hey, guys.

46
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:44,483
No, I don't want
to play video games, Joey!

47
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:49,333
Are you guys going
to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?

48
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,522
Yeah, why?

49
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,122
Me and my friends are
doing Thanksgiving uptown.

50
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,045
I thought you might like to come.

51
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,886
For real?

52
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,527
You should go to Chandler's.
None of us can cook.

53
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,126
We'll just drink all day.

54
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,085
We go to yours!

55
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:09,406
We have to stop across the hall
because it's my sister.

56
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:12,725
But, you know, actually,
growing up with a sister was nice. . .

57
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,123
. . .because it helped me
understand women.

58
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,887
Yeah, you should tell
your friends that.

59
00:03:19,053 --> 00:03:20,088
Okay.

60
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,889
How you got three women to marry you,
I'll never know.

61
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,209
Pheebs, check it out!
For my dessert. . .

62
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:38,881
. . .I'm making a traditional
English trifle.

63
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,688
Wow. That sounds great!
And what are you making, Monica?

64
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:46,010
In case Rachel's dessert is
so good that I eat all of it. . .

65
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,282
. . .and there's none left
for anybody else!

66
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:52,443
Nothing.

67
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:53,922
Nothing?

68
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:56,409
No, sweetie. I trust you.

69
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,846
If I mess this up,
there's nothing else for dessert?

70
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,206
You won't mess it up.

71
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,082
I love that. You really
have faith in me. Thank you.

72
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,126
Question: How do you know
when the butter is done?

73
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,490
It's done about two minutes
before it looks like that.

74
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:20,682
-The food smells great, Mon.
-And the place looks so nice.

75
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:24,130
-Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
-Happy Thanksgiving!

76
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,927
-Well, this has been great.
-See you.

77
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,122
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

78
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,091
Where you going?

79
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:37,206
We did say we'd stop by this little
thing Joey's roommate is having.

80
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,722
Oh, Janine,
the really hot dancer girl?

81
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,490
Some would say she's attractive, yes.

82
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,690
Who else is going to be there?

83
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:46,882
Her friends.

84
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:48,122
Her dancer friends?

85
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,886
Yes! All right?

86
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,205
All of her hot dancer friends
are gonna be there. . .

87
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,684
. . .and they'll be drinking and dancing
and we really want to go!

88
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,930
Dude, we were good.

89
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:04,890
You're not going. You said
you'd eat here and you'll eat here.

90
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,926
Yeah, and leaving us
to go see hot dancer girls. . .

91
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,010
. . .is not very Thanksgiving-y.

92
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:11,692
Oh, but it is.

93
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:16,125
It's like the first Thanksgiving when
the lndians and Pilgrims sat down.

94
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,688
Then the lndians taught
the Pilgrims. . .

95
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,168
. . .what it meant to be hot
in the New World!

96
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,565
-Hello, everybody!
-Hi!

97
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,523
Hi, Dad. Mom.

98
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,691
Look! Look who it is!
It's Chandler!

99
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,567
Oh, yes, of course.
Hello, Chandler.

100
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,129
Mr. and Mrs. Geller,
you look wonderful.

101
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,171
It is great to have you here.
Let us take your coats.

102
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,888
Whoa, it snowing out there?

103
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:45,882
No.

104
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,889
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.

105
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,885
You should do this for a living.

106
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:04,085
Okay, I have dandruff.
There's no need to laugh and point.

107
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:07,684
Chandler was laughing at your joke.

108
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:09,451
My joke wasn't funny.

109
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,889
Rach, I just remembered.

110
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,129
I had a dream
about Mr. Geller last night.

111
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,129
Really?

112
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,126
I dreamt that he saved me
from a burning building. . .

113
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:22,284
. . .and he was so brave and so strong.

114
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,491
And it's making me look at him
totally differently.

115
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,689
He used to be just
"Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad. "

116
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,084
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk. "

117
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,131
I don't know. To me,
he'll always be "Jack Geller. . .

118
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,483
. . .walks in while you're changing. "

119
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:49,084
You know, Dad, Chandler is one
of Ross' very best friends.

120
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,005
Ross sure is a great guy.

121
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:54,131
I've always felt that
how a man turns out. . .

122
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,045
. . .is a reflection on his father.

123
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:59,768
I always thought that too.
Tell me, what does your father do?

124
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,289
He's a headliner of a. . .

125
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,290
. . .gay burlesque show.

126
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,407
You're killing us.
Will you serve the dessert already?

127
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:14,081
There's drunken dancers a-waiting!

128
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,325
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?

129
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,801
Yeah. What is it?

130
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,203
It's a trifle.
It's got all these layers.

131
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:23,490
First there's a layer
of ladyfingers, then jam. . .

132
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:27,442
. . .then custard,
which I made from scratch. . .

133
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,405
. . .then raspberries,
more ladyfingers. . .

134
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,723
. . .then beef sautéed
with peas and onions. . .

135
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,482
. . .then a little bit more custard. . .

136
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,006
. . .then bananas and then
I put whipped cream on top.

137
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,806
What was the one right before bananas?

138
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,086
The beef.
Yeah, that was weird to me too.

139
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,405
But then I thought,
"Well, there's minced meat pie. "

140
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,132
That's an English dessert.

141
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,484
These people just put
strange things in their food.

142
00:07:58,693 --> 00:08:00,490
Can I borrow rum from your place?

143
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:01,802
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,083
While I'm gone,
don't you sneak a taste.

145
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:10,888
Beef in a dessert?

146
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,284
No, no, no. There is no way.

147
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,485
I know. And only one layer of jam?

148
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,848
What is up with that?

149
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,691
Oh, my God.

150
00:08:24,893 --> 00:08:26,770
The pages are stuck together.

151
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:27,803
Chandler!

152
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,884
Oh, my God. She made
half an English trifle and. . .

153
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,772
. . .half a shepherd's pie!

154
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,129
Man, now she's gonna start all over.

155
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:49,888
We're never gonna get to introduce
the hot girls to the New World.

156
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,291
No, no, we will.
We just won't tell her she messed up.

157
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,410
Just let her serve
the beef-custard thing?

158
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,365
Yeah. It'll be like
a funny Thanksgiving story.

159
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,292
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.

160
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:06,365
Joey. God, your apartment
is like a hundred degrees.

161
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:09,087
Did it make you want
to walk around in your underwear?

162
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:10,889
No.

163
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,689
Still not hot enough!

164
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:18,762
Rachel. Okay, look at him.

165
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,203
Look at those strong hands.

166
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:25,082
Oh, what I wouldn't give
to be that can of condensed milk.

167
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:32,333
Chandler was just saying
how beautiful your sweater is.

168
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,165
Thank you. I just bought it.

169
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,764
Yes, well, it's very beautiful and
it's cream-colored and tight and. . . .

170
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,682
I don't mean tight. It's not tight.
Not that I was looking at. . . .

171
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:47,529
What's the matter with him?

172
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,008
I think he's stoned again.

173
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,367
What?

174
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,006
I need to talk to you.

175
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,966
I think I might know why
my parents don't like you.

176
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:04,003
Why?

177
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,681
Okay, remember we were young.

178
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:10,602
Spring break, sophomore year,
I got high in my bedroom. . .

179
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,923
. . .and my parents walked in
and smelled it. . .

180
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:17,132
. . .so I told them that you had gotten
stoned and jumped out the window.

181
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,846
Why did you do that?

182
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,728
I don't know. Yours was the first
name that popped into my head.

183
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,889
I didn't think it'd matter.

184
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,082
How could it not matter?

185
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,722
How was I to know
we'd be friends after college. . .

186
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,884
. . .and you'd be living with my sister?

187
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,851
What about all that
"friends forever" stuff?

188
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,648
I don't know. I was all high.

189
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:47,726
Mom and Dad sent me to find out
if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

190
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:53,732
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
in college, and he blamed it on me!

191
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,286
I can't believe you!

192
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:59,845
We haven't told them we're together
because they hate me, so fix this.

193
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:03,887
Okay, okay, I'll tell them
it wasn't Chandler who got high.

194
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,482
Now, who should I say it was?

195
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,729
You! It's not like it's a big deal.
You don't still do it or anything.

196
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:16,085
All right. Now, who should I say
tricked me into doing it?

197
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,841
Dad, please don't pick
your teeth out here.

198
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,884
And if you're gonna put your feet up--

199
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,566
Leave him alone!

200
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:32,087
Will you hurry up?

201
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,087
Did you not hear me when I told you
that Janine's friends are dancers?

202
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,086
And that they're gonna
be drinking a lot?

203
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:43,532
No, I did. But tell me again
because it's so romantic.

204
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:46,203
You're whipping so slow.
Do it faster!

205
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,489
I don't want to make any mistakes!

206
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:51,491
If I screw it up,
everybody's gonna be like:

207
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:55,692
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

208
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:01,282
Just let me worry about making it,
and you just worry about eating it.

209
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,886
Oh, I am.

210
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:08,281
-If you don't tell them, then I will.
-Okay. Fine.

211
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,487
Ross, can I talk to you for a second?

212
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,401
Can it wait? I have
to tell my parents something.

213
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:16,092
No, it can't? Okay.

214
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:24,006
We have to tell Rachel
she messed up her dessert.

215
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:26,329
What? What is with everybody?

216
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,131
It's Thanksgiving, not. . .

217
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,284
. . .Truth Day!

218
00:12:30,813 --> 00:12:34,442
Look, when everyone eats
that banana-meat thing. . .

219
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,121
. . .they'll all make fun of her.
Do you want that?

220
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,609
We'll just get everyone
to act like they like it.

221
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:42,730
That way, no one makes fun of her. . .

222
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,084
. . .and we still get to go
to sweet potato pie.

223
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,004
Dude, they're not objects.

224
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:53,481
Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
You distract her.

225
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:58,283
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

226
00:13:00,053 --> 00:13:01,281
Okay.

227
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,091
What's up, Ross?

228
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:10,922
So. . . .

229
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,691
Thanksgiving.

230
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,809
The holiday season is upon us.

231
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,286
And. . .

232
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,529
. . .you look nice today.

233
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,965
-Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
-What?

234
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:34,331
I don't think us getting back
together is a good idea.

235
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,564
I thought this might happen today.

236
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,889
I know the holidays can be rough. . .

237
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:45,125
. . .and it's probably hard
for you to be alone right now.

238
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,402
You're alone.

239
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,490
No, I live with Phoebe.

240
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:52,526
I mean, you're alone-alone.

241
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:57,292
And it's just not the time
for us. I'm sorry.

242
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:00,692
Oh, well.
Can't blame a guy for trying.

243
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,607
And if anyone needs help
pretending to like it. . .

244
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:11,687
. . .I learned some things in acting
class. Try rubbing your stomach.

245
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,681
Or saying "Mmm. "

246
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,084
Smiling.

247
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,890
I'm not gonna pay
for those acting classes anymore.

248
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,891
Rachel, there you are.
Let's serve that dessert already!

249
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,092
Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
You don't get any dessert.

250
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,322
Really?

251
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:37,685
No, just kidding.
I would never do that to you.

252
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,606
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.

253
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:44,323
So, Rach, this is a traditional
English trifle, isn't it?

254
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:45,761
-It sure is.
-Wow.

255
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,009
So did you make it
with beef or eggplant?

256
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,643
-Beef.
-I can't have any. I don't eat meat.

257
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166
Monica, I want you
to have the first taste.

258
00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,922
Really?

259
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,885
Wait, you only got whipped cream.

260
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,203
You gotta take a bite
with all the layers.

261
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,608
You dropped a pea.

262
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,088
Well?

263
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,766
It's good.

264
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:35,812
Really? How good?

265
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,924
It's so good that I feel selfish. . .

266
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,283
. . .about being the only one
who's eating it.

267
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,883
I think we should have everyone
taste how good it is.

268
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,089
Especially Ross.

269
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,123
This is so good that I'm gonna
go enjoy it on the balcony.

270
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:02,012
So that I can enjoy the view
whilst I enjoy my dessert.

271
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,131
I've gotta call my friend. . .

272
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,893
. . .and tell her how good
this is from Monica's room.

273
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,327
I'll help dial.

274
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,725
I'm gonna go into the bathroom. . .

275
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,806
. . .so I can look at it
in the mirror as I eat it.

276
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,527
What was that all about?
Does it not taste good?

277
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,883
-Let me try it.
-No, no!

278
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:30,286
All gone!

279
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,891
So good.

280
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,092
Maybe Chandler has some left.

281
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,689
It tastes like feet.

282
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,292
I like it!

283
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,722
Are you kidding?

284
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,403
What's not to like? Custard, good.

285
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:55,690
Jam, good. Meat, good.

286
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,283
So a bird just grabbed it. . .

287
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:06,485
. . .and then tried
to fly away with it. . .

288
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:09,203
. . .and then just dropped it
on the street?

289
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,727
If it's any consolation,
before the bird dropped it. . .

290
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,924
. . .he seemed to enjoy it.

291
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,562
Rachel, come here.

292
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,963
I was taking my Thanksgiving nap
and I had another dream.

293
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:27,085
-Do I want to hear this?
-I don't know, let's see.

294
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,330
I dreamt we were getting married. . .

295
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,286
. . .and he left because
he had to go fight a fire.

296
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,883
So I went to a nightclub
and I saw him making out with a girl.

297
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,852
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!

298
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,091
But then Jacques Cousteau came. . .

299
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,523
. . .and he kicked his ass
for betraying me.

300
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,331
So cool!

301
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,730
Then he took me diving
and introduced me to his sea horse. . .

302
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:54,171
. . .who was coming on to me.
Please, that is not gonna happen.

303
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,850
Boy, I'm glad I wore
the big belt today.

304
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:05,083
Five minutes ago, a line like that
would have floored me.

305
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:09,122
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
I am still a woman.

306
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,250
Ross? Let's go.

307
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,888
Oh, yeah.
About telling Mom and Dad. . .

308
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,812
. . .I was thinking about
maybe writing a letter.

309
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,129
That's it. You've had your chance.

310
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:27,368
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.

311
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,682
You are such a tattletale!

312
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:35,891
Mom, Dad. . .

313
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,686
. . .you remember that time
you walked in my room. . .

314
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,605
. . .and smelled marijuana?

315
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:42,723
Yes.

316
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:48,885
I told you it was Chandler. . .

317
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,330
. . .who was smoking the pot but. . .

318
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,482
. . .it was me. I'm sorry.

319
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:57,962
It was you?

320
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,728
Dad, you know that mailman
that you got fired?

321
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,488
He didn't steal your Playboys.
Ross did.

322
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:12,882
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
the porch swing. Monica did!

323
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,961
Ross hasn't worked
at the museum for a year!

324
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,126
Monica and Chandler
are living together!

325
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:28,852
Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
And got divorced! Again!

326
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,530
I love Jacques Cousteau!

327
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:39,086
I wasn't supposed
to put beef in the trifle!

328
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,882
I want to go!

329
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:48,731
That's a lot of information
to get in 30 seconds.

330
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,970
All right. Joey, if you want
to leave, just leave.

331
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,726
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
to put beef in the trifle.

332
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:00,850
It did not taste good.

333
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:05,329
Phoebe, I'm sorry. . .

334
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,684
. . .but I think
Jacques Cousteau is dead.

335
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,925
Monica, why you felt
you had to hide the fact. . .

336
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,886
. . .that you're in an important
relationship is beyond me.

337
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,886
And we kind of figured
about the porch swing.

338
00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:21,842
Ross.

339
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,122
Drugs?

340
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,250
Divorced again?

341
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,127
What happened, son?

342
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:33,082
I got tricked into all those things.

343
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:39,089
Chandler, you've been
Ross' best friend all these years. . .

344
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:42,012
. . .stuck by him
during the drug problems. . .

345
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,932
. . .and now you've taken on
Monica as well.

346
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:50,245
Well, I don't know what to say.

347
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,284
You're a wonderful human being.

348
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,685
-Thank you!
-No.

349
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,651
Thank you!

350
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:04,689
Monica and Ross, I don't know what
I'm gonna do about the two of you.

351
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,489
I'll talk to them.

352
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,410
You guys, it was bananas. . .

353
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,883
. . .cream and beef!

354
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:22,402
I just cannot believe that you ate
that so that I wouldn't feel bad.

355
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,730
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
It's still in the bathroom.

356
00:21:25,933 --> 00:21:26,888
No, I ate that.

357
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,524
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.

358
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,928
Nope, got it and got yours too.
