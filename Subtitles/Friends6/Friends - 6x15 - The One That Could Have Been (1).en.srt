1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:04,370
Hey, you guys, guess what?

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:07,490
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:10,243
What is the matter with you?

4
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,488
No. Barry and Mindy.

5
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:17,849
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce,"
I immediately go to Ross.

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:20,611
Who's Barry and Mindy?

7
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:23,969
Barry was the guy I almost married,
and Mindy was my best friend.

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,725
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?

9
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:29,203
That means he was falling
asleep on her instead of me.

10
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:34,401
Can you imagine if I'd married him?
How different would my life be?

11
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:37,212
I've always wondered
how different life would be. . .

12
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:39,170
. . .if I'd never gotten divorced.

13
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:41,209
-Which time?
-The first time!

14
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:45,330
Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
she was a lesbian.

15
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:50,689
I can't.
I keep seeing it the good way.

16
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:54,202
I bet I'd still be doing my karate.

17
00:00:55,652 --> 00:01:00,328
Towards the end of our marriage,
I did karate to release the tension. . .

18
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:03,530
. . .from not doing anything
else physical.

19
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,127
Maybe the problem was
pronouncing it ka-ra-tay.

20
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,290
What if I was still fat?

21
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,926
You wouldn't be dating me,
that's for sure.

22
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,686
-Sure I would.
-Come on.

23
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,123
You think I'm that shallow?

24
00:01:17,372 --> 00:01:19,010
I think Monica was that fat.

25
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:24,482
Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired
off Days of Our Lives.

26
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,842
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.

27
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:30,971
What if I had had the guts
to quit my job?

28
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:34,921
I'd probably be writing for the New
Yorker, being paid to be funny.

29
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:38,005
But my job's fun too.
I mean, tomorrow. . .

30
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:40,083
. . .I don't have to wear a tie.

31
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,408
What if I'd taken that job
at Merrill Lynch?

32
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:45,444
-What?
-Merrill Lynch?

33
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:49,810
A massage client who worked there
said I had a knack for stocks.

34
00:01:50,052 --> 00:01:51,167
Why didn't you take it?

35
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:54,882
At that time, I thought everything
that rhymed was true.

36
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,003
I thought if I worked with stocks. . .

37
00:01:57,252 --> 00:02:01,450
. . .I'd have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.

38
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:07,448
Do you think if all those things
happened, we'd still hang out?

39
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:12,683
The One That Could Have Been
Part 1

40
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:13,841
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

41
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,764
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?

42
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,971
Rob Tilman!

43
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,204
No, no, it's me. Ross.

44
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:01,524
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.

45
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:07,168
-No. No, no. Ross Geller.
-Of course! Monica's brother.

46
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,880
-Yeah. Right.
-Wow! How are you?

47
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:11,884
Good. Good, I'm married.

48
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,691
Me too!

49
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,490
-Isn't it the best?
-Oh, it's the best.

50
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:23,528
-So how's Monica?
-Really, really great.

51
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:28,288
Actually, she's right down the street.
You should stop by and say hi.

52
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,092
-I would love to.
-She'd be so excited.

53
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,162
-Okay.
-Come on.

54
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:34,483
Wait, don't you have
to pay for. . .

55
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,489
...Busty Ladies?

56
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:43,482
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me
to pick it up for him, but l. . . .

57
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,962
So, Monica.
Still going out with Dr. Boring?

58
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,881
He's not boring. He's just. . . .

59
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:02,601
He's low-key.

60
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:06,325
-Here you go, one hazelnut latte.
-Thank you.

61
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:10,087
You know, the hazelnut,
actually not a nut.

62
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,084
It's a seed.

63
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:14,291
Wow.

64
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:19,643
Can anyone else name a well-known seed
that's been masquerading as a nut?

65
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,281
Oh, dear God. Let me think.

66
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,085
What's the matter?

67
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,691
Another rejection letter.

68
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:32,328
They said my writing was funny,
just not "Archie Comic" funny.

69
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,483
I must get back to the hospital.

70
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,284
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

71
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:42,884
By the way, the answer is:
The Brazil nut.

72
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,131
Was his question,
"What's more boring than him?"

73
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:52,087
Hey, man.
Sorry about that Archie thing.

74
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,771
You need some money?

75
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:57,084
Hey, I may have no money,
but I still have my pride.

76
00:04:58,572 --> 00:04:59,561
Really?

77
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,888
Joey doesn't have to give you money.

78
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:08,851
-TV stars have assistants, right?
-That's an idea.

79
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,084
If I hire an assistant,
would you take money from her?

80
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:15,330
No, Joey.
Chandler could be your assistant.

81
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,608
He could answer
your fan mail and stuff.

82
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,888
That would be great! Let's do that!

83
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,850
I could use the money.

84
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:23,684
-Welcome aboard!
-Okay!

85
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,883
I need to use the bathroom.

86
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,084
Since I don't need assistance
in there, take a break!

87
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:30,481
All right.

88
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:33,887
-Hey.
-Hey, Phoebe.

89
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,689
Joey just hired Chandler.

90
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,928
That's so sweet.

91
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,321
Oh! Hang on!

92
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,290
Hang on!

93
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,087
Go!

94
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,004
No. No, no.
I said sell when it hits 50!

95
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:54,688
Five-oh! It's a number!
It comes after four-nine!

96
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:58,682
No, it's okay. It's okay.
You're allowed one mistake.

97
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,888
Just kidding.
You are fired.

98
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:08,087
Hey, Mon?
Mon, look who I ran into!

99
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,370
Oh, my God, Rachel!

100
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,765
-God, you look terrific!
-So do you!

101
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:21,609
-Did you lose weight?
-You are so sweet to notice.

102
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:23,331
I lost 3 1 \2 pounds!

103
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:29,930
You remember my friend Chandler?

104
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,366
And that's Phoebe.

105
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:35,761
Sit down. How long's it
been since we've seen each other?

106
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:39,408
1 987, the day after Christmas.
Sean McMahan's party.

107
00:06:39,652 --> 00:06:43,930
I played you one of my songs.
"Interplanetary Courtship Ritual. "

108
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,932
Oh, yeah. Right.

109
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:51,323
-So, now, do you still do music?
-Well, sometimes.

110
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:54,040
-Sometime I'll play you--
-Oh, my God!

111
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:59,491
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives
just walked in here!

112
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:04,211
-Rach, he's a friend of ours.
-You're friends with Drake Ramoray?

113
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,524
It's hard to be Drake's friend. . .

114
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,367
. . .because of his busy schedule
and the fact that he's not real.

115
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,128
Hey, or I could bring
my keyboard here sometime.

116
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,771
-He's coming over.
-Joey?

117
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,291
I know. Here, here.

118
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,523
No. This is Rachel.
We went to high school together.

119
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,285
-Hi.
-Hi.

120
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,969
I love you on that show.

121
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,970
I watch you every day.

122
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:36,050
When you took out your
kidney to save your ex-wife. . .

123
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,886
. . .even though
she tried to kill you. . . .

124
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,404
It's always nice to meet fans.

125
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:44,888
-She's not crazy, is she?
-No.

126
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,290
So how you doing?

127
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,486
Hang on.

128
00:07:57,452 --> 00:08:00,683
Hang on. Hang on.

129
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,761
Go!

130
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,286
Who's this?

131
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:06,488
You're gonna like working for me.

132
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,281
What's your name?
What kind of name is Brindy?

133
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,010
Stop talking.

134
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:17,291
All right, from now on
your name is Joan.

135
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,688
You can pick your own last name.

136
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:24,046
-There you are.
-Uh-oh, it's my boss.

137
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,370
Here's a list of things for you
to do today.

138
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,728
This'll be so great.
Thank you so much.

139
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:33,931
Gotta go to work. I'm delivering
twins, but only one is mine.

140
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,486
"Drop off my dry cleaning.
Pick up my vitamins. "

141
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,850
Teach me how to spell vitamins.

142
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,763
"Wear in my new jeans. "

143
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:52,687
You realize what you are, don't you?

144
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,411
You're his bitch!

145
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,201
No, no! No!

146
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:00,887
Wait! You didn't sit on my
Kit Kats did you?

147
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,329
No, there was a little,
little dip in the market. . .

148
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,449
. . .and I lost $1 3,000,000.

149
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,683
But the Kit Kats are all right?

150
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:12,325
What am I gonna do?
My office will kill me.

151
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,530
I can't call my clients,
they'll kill themselves!

152
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,286
-All right, now my chest hurts.
-What?

153
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,250
My chest hurts.

154
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:25,361
-And now, I can't breathe.
-Are you having a heart attack?

155
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:29,048
If I were, would I have shooting
pains up and down my left arm?

156
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:32,011
-Yes.
-Then, yes. That is what I'm having.

157
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,890
Oh, my God!

158
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:41,127
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.

159
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,409
Most people'd be excited if they
didn't work for two weeks.

160
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,530
Most people don't like their jobs.
I love my job.

161
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:51,685
I've been not working for three hours,
and I'm already going crazy.

162
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,405
I miss Joan.

163
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:58,128
Honey, a heart attack is nature's
way of telling you to slow down.

164
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:01,887
I always thought it was nature's way
of telling you to die.

165
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:04,925
You're not gonna die.

166
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:09,290
I mean, you are going to die,
but you're not gonna die today.

167
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,681
I wish I was dead.

168
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:13,481
Let's take a walk.

169
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:17,287
You should consider writing for
Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.

170
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,331
What's going on with you?

171
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:27,488
Well, I've been doing a lot more
of my karate.

172
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,282
-Still a dry spell with Carol?
-Yeah.

173
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,847
How long has it been since
you've had sex?

174
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:37,084
-Well, last weekend. . .
-That's not so bad.

175
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,892
. . .will be two months. . .

176
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,892
. . .since I stopped trying.

177
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:45,770
You need to spice things up.

178
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,411
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.

179
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:50,769
You could tie her up.
You could eat stuff off each other.

180
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,687
Dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys.

181
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,927
Role-playing.
You're warden, she's prisoner.

182
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,482
-You're the pirate, she's the wench.
-Okay, I think I got it.

183
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:06,407
You could be two stockbrokers,
rolling naked on the trading floor. . .

184
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,563
. . .and everybody's watching.

185
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,844
It never happened.

186
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:19,283
And over there is Brady's Pub. . .

187
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:22,325
. . .where I unwind
after a long day of "surgeoning. "

188
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:25,132
This is so amazing. What else?

189
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,284
Well, that is a large piece
of television equipment.

190
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,130
And that is an old man.

191
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:31,885
-Hey, old man!
-Hey.

192
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,209
Alrighty. What do you say we head
back to my place?

193
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:40,682
You know, I would really love to,
but I shouldn't.

194
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:45,084
Why?
Why can't the world stop turning?

195
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,125
Just for a moment. Just for us.

196
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:52,291
Isn't that from the show?

197
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,490
Yeah, but. . .

198
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,490
. . .I may have said
those things before, but. . .

199
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:03,685
. . .I never truly meant them until now.

200
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:06,651
That's from the show too!

201
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:09,330
Okay, you watch too much TV.

202
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,925
Here's the freshly
squeezed orange juice you asked for.

203
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:14,048
Thanks.

204
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:17,283
There's pulp in that.

205
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,130
I thought we talked about this.
I don't like pulp.

206
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:26,840
No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
All juice.

207
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,850
I'm sorry.
I guess I just like the pulp.

208
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:33,889
I'm sorry.
I am being so rude.

209
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:37,120
Rachel, would you like a soda
or something?

210
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:41,001
Because Chandler will
run right out and get it.

211
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:44,012
Yeah, well, sure,
iced tea would be great.

212
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:45,406
Iced tea.

213
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,760
Okay. Anything for you, sir?

214
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:53,283
Did I not just tell him?

215
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,532
Okay, look, Chandler,
if this is gonna work. . .

216
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:01,287
. . .you have got to listen.

217
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,003
You're gonna throw that juice at me?

218
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,366
It's not all juice.

219
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:15,884
Honey, this morning was fun.

220
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:19,727
Me hopping in on you
in the shower there?

221
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:23,408
Yeah, maybe someday we could get
a place with two bathrooms.

222
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,287
Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe. . .

223
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:33,245
. . .maybe we can spice things
up a little.

224
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:36,564
-What do you mean?
-Carol, our sex life. It's just not--

225
00:13:36,812 --> 00:13:39,884
-Dad!
-Hey there, little fella!

226
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,328
Why don't we
get some shoes on you?

227
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,405
Show dad how you
put your shoes on in your room.

228
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,682
Seriously, our sex life.

229
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,728
I was thinking maybe, I don't know. . .

230
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:57,725
. . .we could try some new
things, you know, for fun.

231
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:00,691
-Like what?
-Well, I don't know.

232
00:14:03,132 --> 00:14:05,487
What if we were to. . .

233
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,283
. . .tie each other up?

234
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:19,404
Some people eat stuff
off one another.

235
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,530
Yeah.

236
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:26,287
You know, we could try dirty talk.

237
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:32,086
-We could have a threesome.
-I love that idea!

238
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,924
Who sold a story to "Archie Comics"?

239
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,891
Oh, my God, that's so great.

240
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,691
You're a published writer.
I wish I had a present.

241
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:44,927
Wait a minute.

242
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:49,888
My last Kit Kat bar.

243
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:56,482
-You want to share it?
-Okay!

244
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:02,732
Chandler, I know you're mad.
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:02,972 --> 00:15:07,284
I was a total jerk.
Completely over the line.

246
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:09,403
I just. . . . I hate pulp.

247
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:13,332
You know how Monica feels
about low-fat mayonnaise?

248
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,483
It's not mayonnaise!

249
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:21,687
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, and here.

250
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,522
-What's this?
-Fresh orange juice, with pulp.

251
00:15:25,772 --> 00:15:29,082
-Just the way you like.
-Thanks, man.

252
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:35,444
Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story
to "Archie Comics. "

253
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,764
That's great! Congratulations!
What's the story?

254
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:42,129
You wouldn't care.
It's just a stupid comic book story.

255
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,728
Are you kidding me?
I love Archie and the whole gang.

256
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:52,289
Well, Archie needs money
to fix his jalopy.

257
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:59,208
But he doesn't want Reggie
to just give him the money.

258
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:01,966
So Reggie hires him as his assist--

259
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,884
--as his butler.

260
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,210
And makes him do crazy things. . .

261
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,683
. . .Iike bring him milk shakes
that can't have lumps.

262
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,723
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little familiar.

263
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,087
Did they already do that?
I think I read it!

264
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,806
Monica, listen. I have to ask.

265
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:32,091
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
to his apartment.

266
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:36,888
-Does he do this with a lot of girls?
-Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.

267
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,810
And I'm one of them.

268
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:45,889
I just cannot believe this.
I mean, Joey Tribbiani.

269
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:48,407
It's none of my business,
but aren't you married?

270
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:49,880
Yeah.

271
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:55,130
I wish we could just not be married
for a little bit.

272
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:59,081
You know, I just wish we could be,
like, on a break.

273
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,771
Well, you're not.

274
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:07,328
It's easy for you. You
can have sex with whoever you want.

275
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,085
Yeah, I can.

276
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:11,931
Don't think I don't. I do.

277
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,083
I mean, all the time. You bet!

278
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:17,685
Monica?

279
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,402
You've done it, right?

280
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:27,883
Of course I have. What do you think,
I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?

281
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,489
Oh, my God.
You're a 30-year-old virgin.

282
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:35,802
Louder. I don't think
the guy in the back heard.

283
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,690
Yeah, I heard it.

284
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,686
It's not like I haven't had the
opportunity.

285
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,883
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

286
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,806
I'm seeing this guy.
He's not perfect. . .

287
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:50,327
. . .but I'm thinking maybe I should
get it over with.

288
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,290
You know, give him my flower.

289
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:59,644
Oh, my God, do it!
Honey, you've waited long enough.

290
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:04,289
-You know what? You are right.
-Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.

291
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:07,290
There shouldn't be all these
rules and restrictions.

292
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:10,484
People should be able to sleep
with whoever, whenever--

293
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:14,122
Rachel. I'll never think it's
okay to cheat on your husband.

294
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:16,084
What do you know, virgin?

295
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:23,487
Phoebe?

296
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:26,490
Why is smoke coming out
of the bathroom?

297
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,321
The doctor said that could be
one of the side effects.

298
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:33,201
Put the cigarette out.

299
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:37,161
No, it's not a cigarette.
The smoke is coming out of me!

300
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:40,285
-Put it out.
-Okay, okay!

301
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:45,365
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Come on.

302
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:47,967
Give it to me!

303
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:49,491
-I got it.
-Give it!

304
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,280
Hello?

305
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,769
She can't come to the phone now.

306
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,245
Right. No problem.
Okay, bye-bye.

307
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,881
Was it work?
Was it Jack? Did he yell?

308
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:06,362
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.

309
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,172
Jack was making sure you
were getting better.

310
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:10,691
Thank God.

311
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:12,726
Yeah, she's fired.

312
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,922
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.

313
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:21,083
You've got to let her go.

314
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:24,686
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.

315
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,770
Not so fast, Wesley.

316
00:19:29,772 --> 00:19:30,568
Ramoray!

317
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,123
That's right, Wesley.

318
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:37,888
Ijust stopped by to say that
you're not a real doctor.

319
00:19:38,132 --> 00:19:41,044
And that woman 's brain is fine.

320
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,884
Oh, thank God.

321
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:55,131
-Hope? Hope?
-Drake.

322
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:56,566
You're not dying, Hope.

323
00:19:56,932 --> 00:20:00,607
You're gonna live a long,
healthy life. With me.

324
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,371
Oh, Drake.

325
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,246
Okay.

326
00:20:08,852 --> 00:20:10,080
Here we go.

327
00:20:15,972 --> 00:20:18,884
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.

328
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:22,090
I am free tomorrow night.

329
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,492
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some
sandwiches.
