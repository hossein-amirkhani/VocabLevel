1
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:05,127
Can you help me pick
an engagement ring?

2
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:10,207
I don't know. Should I get her a
Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a--

3
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:12,649
Paper cut?!

4
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:17,844
-Have you told anyone else?
-No, I don't want Monica to find out.

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,087
You told me.

6
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:21,562
Because I trust you,
and we're friends. . .

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,525
. . .and you saw me looking
at ring brochures.

8
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:27,802
Once again, not knocking pays off.

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,570
-I wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
-Me too.

10
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,882
-Want to go to the coffeehouse?
-Oh, all right.

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,487
We were just gonna see
if you wanted to go.

12
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:43,968
Well, we don't, because
we got the other place.

13
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:48,967
How rude.

14
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:50,800
Sorry. Want a bite?

15
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,203

17
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,886
So how are things going with Paul?

18
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:34,121
Good.

19
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:36,761
Although, you know,
he's a private guy.

20
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,009
I wish I could get him to open up.
Share some feelings.

21
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:44,689
You just have to think of him
as a jar of pickles that won't open.

22
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:50,286
I should run him under hot water
and bang his head against a table?

23
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:54,962
That's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.

24
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,691
-Watch this.
-Okay.

25
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,411
-Hey, Paul.
-Hi, Phoebe.

26
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:05,324
How are things going with you?

27
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,564
Can't complain.

28
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,685
-Hey!
-Hi.

29
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,605
-Great to--
-Ross, good to see you too.

30
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:20,365
You take care.

31
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:28,882
What was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?

32
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,804
That was so weird, huh?

33
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:33,441
Why did you do it?

34
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,968
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.

35
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:39,363
He's mad at you.

36
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:43,362
-What? Why?
-Oh, please. I think you know why.

37
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:45,845
I can't think of anything.

38
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,562
Come on. You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.

39
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:56,370
Is it because Joey and I didn't
invite him to that Knicks game?

40
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:59,764
Is that something
he'd be mad at you for?

41
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,563
-I guess it could.
-Well, then I think that's it.

42
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:08,684
If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.

43
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:13,767
You should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.

44
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:19,490
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden.

45
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah, that's great.

46
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:25,171
But first, talk to me.
Talk to me. Tell me about your day.

47
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,251
It was fine.

48
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:29,807
Okay.

49
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:34,047
What are you thinking right now?

50
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,728
That you are looking
really fine in that dress.

51
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:40,972
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know. . . .

52
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,650
I want to know what--
Wow, those are really great!

53
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,811
I just want to know. . .

54
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:53,011
. . .what is behind this strong,
silent exterior?

55
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:57,882
They say that still waters run deep,
and I want to swim in yours.

56
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,690
Are you talking about having sex?

57
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:04,571
No, Paul.

58
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:09,288
I don't know anything about you.
Tell me about your childhood.

59
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,726
Normal.

60
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:15,320
Then how about puberty? Come on!
That's always a painful time.

61
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:19,167
Your pals have a slumber party
and stick your hand in warm water. . .

62
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:22,131
. . .while you sleep so you pee
in your sleeping bag.

63
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:26,049
No, that never happened to me.

64
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:30,122
Well, you're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.

65
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:32,047
Anyway. . . .

66
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:35,725
The rest of your life. Any regrets?

67
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,767
No.

68
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,569
I'm not asking for a lot here.

69
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:43,770
Just give me something. Anything.

70
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:46,569
-Okay.
-Okay.

71
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:52,961
When I was 6 years old,
I wanted a Big Wheel.

72
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:55,971
And instead, my parents
got me this little. . .

73
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,761
. . .plastic chicken
that you hop around on.

74
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,522
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.

75
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,444
That was a pretty tough year.

76
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,962
That's great! See?

77
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:11,363
I already feel like I know you
a little better.

78
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,166
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat. Let's go!

79
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:17,921
It was horrible.

80
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:23,168
They called me "Chicken Boy. "

81
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:33,564
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, not really.

82
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:35,410
Richard Danville bit me on the nose.

83
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:39,042
I still have a little scar right here.
You can see it.

84
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,362
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.

85
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:46,362
I think this is really great that,
you know, you've shared your feelings.

86
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,364
It's really. . . .
It's beautiful.

87
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:51,769
But what do you say we
go share some food?

88
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:53,570
No, I couldn't eat now.

89
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,407
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken!

90
00:05:58,972 --> 00:05:59,961
Chicken?

91
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,769
-Chicken Boy!
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

92
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:18,008
This is the nine millionth ring store,
and I can't find the perfect ring.

93
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,483
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring. . . .

94
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,163
It's a beautiful selection.

95
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:32,365
So maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different.

96
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,684
An engagement bracelet.
Or an engagement tiara!

97
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:40,569
An engagement Revolutionary War musket!

98
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:44,770
I'm so glad I picked you
to help me with this.

99
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:46,889
Imagine getting down on one knee. . .

100
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:50,283
. . .and handing her this gorgeous
piece of weaponry?

101
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:53,124
I'm gonna stick with the ring.

102
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:56,731
This one's nice. I like it.

103
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:59,964
Sir?
Kind sir, can I see this one?

104
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:03,804
This is the reason you brought me.
I know how to haggle.

105
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,644
Let me handle this from here.

106
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,245
Can I help you?

107
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,723
-I would like to see that ring, please.
-Or not. Whatever.

108
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,770
This ring is from the 1 920s.

109
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:17,163
It's a one and a half carat diamond
with sapphires.

110
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,970
Sir, could I ask you to. . .?

111
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,245
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?

112
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:26,564
-Okay.
-Okay.

113
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:29,691
Will you marry me?

114
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,967
Oh, my God, that's it!
That's the ring!

115
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,647
-How much is it?
-I will handle this.

116
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,570
How much is it?

117
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,731
$8600.

118
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,167
We will give you $1 0.

119
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,888
-Are you interested in this ring?
-Yes.

120
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,088
But I can only pay $8000.

121
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,522
-Okay. I can let it go for 8.
-We stand firm at $1 0.

122
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,407
-How'd you like to pay?
-Credit card.

123
00:07:56,652 --> 00:07:59,086
Oh, no! I lent my
credit card to Joey.

124
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:01,368
I'll go get it.
You guard the ring.

125
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:05,327
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

126
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,802
Do you have anything here for $1 0?

127
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,010
Yes. I have these two
rather beautiful. . .

128
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:13,561
. . .five-dollar bills.

129
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,762
I'll give you $1 for them.

130
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:23,324
Remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?

131
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:24,801
No.

132
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,368
-Remember, you were eating pizza?
-Yeah.

133
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:35,527
Chandler's angry at us for not getting
him a ticket to that Knicks game.

134
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:40,807
We were supposed to just get him one?
That guy's always mooching off of us.

135
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:46,166
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up.

136
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:49,449
We could get him tickets to another
Knicks game and invite him.

137
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:53,571
That's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.

138
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:54,888
Here you go.

139
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:58,249
Hey, hey. I got this one.
Here you go.

140
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,766
Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.

141
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:06,369
We do stuff all the time without you,
and you don't get all upset.

142
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:11,167
-All the time?
-All the time.

143
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,367
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

144
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:19,290
-Still crying?
-Like a little girl.

145
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,480
I know, I know. This is all my fault.

146
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,404
I wanted him to open up.

147
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,086
I didn't know that
I was gonna unleash. . .

148
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:32,166
. . .this weepy, clingy,
moist monster!

149
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:35,690
I only know of two sure-fire ways
to shut a man up.

150
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:36,887
One of them is sex.

151
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,330
-What's the other?
-Don't know. Never had to use it.

152
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:44,882
I'm just saying, if we're having sex,
he's not talking.

153
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,248
That's right. You're the talker.

154
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,485
Anyway, great idea.

155
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,801
I gotta buy him some more tissues.

156
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:58,168
-We have some here.
-No, you don't!

157
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:05,162
Okay. I'd also like
to try on the tiara.

158
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,605
Oh, yeah. Okay.

159
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:13,730
What do you think? Too much?

160
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:15,965
A tad.

161
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,562
Take the tiara back. . .

162
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,361
. . .and let me hold the musket again.

163
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,163
Something's missing.

164
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,485
Let me see the ring that
my friend picked out.

165
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,767
Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring?

166
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,122
I just sold it to that gentleman.

167
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:42,964
Oh, my God!

168
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,770
Wait, no!

169
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:51,169
Let me out! Now!

170
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:57,967
Rachel?

171
00:10:58,252 --> 00:10:59,367
No.

172
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,966
-How are you, Paul?
-Okay.

173
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:08,960
Chandler. . .

174
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,881
-. . .did your dad ever hug you?
-No. Did he hug you?

175
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,810
No! No.

176
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,044
It's just that my dad never did.

177
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:22,841
I miss my dad.

178
00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,164
You can see my dad in Vegas
kissing other dads.

179
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,363
-Hey, Chandler?
-Yeah?

180
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:34,965
Would you. . .?

181
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,127
Would you hug me?

182
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,765
-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
-That's what my dad used to say.

183
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,171
Okay. A quick one.
Come on, hug it out.

184
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,565
There you go.

185
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,165
Okay.

186
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:58,563
-Five more seconds--
-Okay!

187
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,567
-Joey!
-What? Hey, what--?

188
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,163
Hi. Paul, is it?

189
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,891
-Do you have my credit card?
-Yeah. It's in my. . . .

190
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,690
In my pocket.

191
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,930
-My back pocket!
-Thank God.

192
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:23,883
-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
-I can't go.

193
00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,201
It'll be fun.

194
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:29,764
Me, you, Ross and. . . .
Paul, probably.

195
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,842
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.

196
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,765
I'm gonna go with
the one I picked first.

197
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:42,607
Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one
you picked is gone. It's over!

198
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,242
What?

199
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:48,811
Some guy bought it. I tried to stop
him but they put me in jail!

200
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,761
-They put you in jail?
-The little jail between the doors!

201
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,089
-I asked you to guard the ring!
-I know! I'm sorry.

202
00:12:57,332 --> 00:13:01,007
But this ring is better. And Monica
never even saw the other ring.

203
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:05,530
Yeah. But when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goosebumps.

204
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,607
-Maybe it was the guy.
-It was the ring!

205
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:15,206
-Was he excited about the tickets?
-No! He blew us off!

206
00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,363
-What?
-I know.

207
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,370
I can't believe it.

208
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,570
Can I tell you something?

209
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,168
I'm a little mad at him now!

210
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,369
Can I tell you something?

211
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,365
Me too!

212
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:35,405
He didn't want to talk to us
about being angry?

213
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,041
Maybe we don't talk to him at all!

214
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,085
-Freeze him out.
-Right!

215
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:43,731
-I like it.
-We'll show him.

216
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:47,806
From now on, it's gonna be
Joey and Ross, best friends.

217
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,842
We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.

218
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,451
Hi, I'm back.

219
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,603
I've written down more to tell you!

220
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,570
Oh, that's great.

221
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,766
No, actually, that's. . . .

222
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,446
That's great. That's really great.

223
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:11,890
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me. . . .

224
00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,805
It gets me kind of hot.

225
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:17,361
Wait, wait. Listen to this:

226
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,971
Know what I wanted to be at that age?

227
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,561
A lover?

228
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,924
-A surfer.
-A surfer?

229
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:28,609
-I wanted to be one with the waves--
-Hold on.

230
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:33,050
Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.

231
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,281
Wait a second.

232
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,490
-This isn't too revealing, is it?
-No.

233
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,561
Whatever happened to that little dude?

234
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,763
So full of dreams.

235
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,367
I don't care about the little dude!

236
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:52,690
I can't! I cannot listen
to any more of this!

237
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:56,163
The only one who'd listen
is a mental health professional!

238
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,607
That's only because
they get $1 00 an hour!

239
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:02,686
Do you know how much money I could've
made listening to you? $2000!

240
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:05,765
Know when I figured that out?
While you were talking!

241
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:10,651
I can't believe you're trying
to stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago. . .

242
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,248
. . .we figured out that that's what
my mother was trying to do to me!

243
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,971
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:20,767
I don't mean. . . .
I didn't mean to stifle you.

245
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:24,165
This is all just
a little overwhelming.

246
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,363
I'm so sorry.

247
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,850
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.

248
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:33,811
It's just that
when those gates open. . .

249
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:37,769
. . .it's hard to close them.

250
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,567
But they are closed now. Believe me.

251
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,361
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

252
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:49,366
And I'm glad that you're done.

253
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,967
So what do you say we. . . .

254
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:57,286
I'd really like that.

255
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:11,968
That was so good!

256
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,365
Oh, oh.

257
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:29,530
I can't believe you talked me into
this gumball-machine-looking ring.

258
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:33,368
It's not gumball machine-looking.
It's a beautiful ring!

259
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,005
No, it's not.

260
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,688
When I looked at the other ring,
I could see Monica's face. . .

261
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,371
. . .and see her saying yes.

262
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,563
When I look at this,
all I see is a ring.

263
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:46,970
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.

264
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:56,362
This is the most important thing I'll
ever do. I want to make it perfect.

265
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,966
Maybe we could get
the other ring back.

266
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,806
I heard where
the guy was gonna propose.

267
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:05,043
Maybe we could get him to trade rings.

268
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,645
I can't do that.

269
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:09,765
You certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.

270
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,765
There he is.

271
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,611
He hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on her finger.

272
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:26,561
Wow, you're good!
After this, we should solve crimes.

273
00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:28,001
Okay. Go get him.

274
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,687
Oh, okay.

275
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:36,047
Excuse me, sir. Could you
come with me? You have a phone call.

276
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,649
-Who is it?
-It is your office.

277
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,167
-Do you know who at my office?
-John.

278
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,447
Oh, John! Great!

279
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,849
-There he is.
-Hi. Okay.

280
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,969
There was a mix-up at the store.

281
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:53,363
The ring you have was supposed
to be held for me.

282
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:55,682
I'm gonna need to have that back.

283
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:02,163
In exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.

284
00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,050
Wow, I would trade.

285
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,842
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
this one. Excuse me.

286
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,289
This is my fiancée,
and her heart was set on that ring.

287
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,170
Do you want to break her heart?

288
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:19,724
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?

289
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,965
You're dying?

290
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,885
Yeah, she's dying. . .

291
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:29,202
. . .of a cough, apparently.

292
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:34,971
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
If I'm not buried with it. . .

293
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:38,170
. . .my spirit will wander
the netherworld--

294
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,487
That's enough, honey!

295
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:42,730
Oh, I don't know.

296
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:45,807
-Let me see it.
-Great.

297
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:47,371
Okay, here.

298
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:52,206
-All right, I'll do it.
-Thank you.

299
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,489
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.

300
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,362
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman!

301
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:10,881
Guys?

302
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,283
I got something important to tell you.

303
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:18,966
Guys.

304
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,567
Guys?

305
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,165
Guys?

306
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,162
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

307
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:31,767
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.

308
00:19:34,012 --> 00:19:35,764
Wait. Is this for real?

309
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,764
Yeah. Check out the ring.

310
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,568
Oh, my God!

311
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:43,766
So you two are really serious?

312
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:47,364
Yeah, pretty much.

313
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,566
You're gonna get married?

314
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:54,166
We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Come here!

315
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:58,051
And we're gonna be friends again.

316
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:01,366
What?

317
00:20:01,572 --> 00:20:04,370
-Water under the bridge! Forget it!
-Okay.

318
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:08,562
I was gonna wait till it was official,
but I had to tell you guys.

319
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:10,484
You're my best friends.

320
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,451
I think I'm gonna cry.

321
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,808
Oh! No more crying!

322
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,885
I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.

323
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,161
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

324
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,204
Oh, my God!

325
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,010
Oh, my God!

326
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:29,324
Oh, Chandler!
You guys are gonna be so happy!

327
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:32,564
-I know.
-Where's all the tissues?!

328
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:40,081
Check out the ring.

329
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,165
Oh, nice. One and a half carat, easy.

330
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,127
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

331
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:49,842
-He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
-I helped pick out the ring.

332
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,005
You told her before you told us?

333
00:20:56,852 --> 00:21:01,368
She walked in while I was looking at
brochures. You can understand that.

334
00:21:02,972 --> 00:21:04,371
Guys?

335
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,331
Guys?
