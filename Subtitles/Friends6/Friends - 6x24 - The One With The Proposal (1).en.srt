1
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:06,571
That is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

2
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:09,969
You should know,
you bought like a billion of them.

3
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,525
You didn't get one.

4
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,890
Tonight's the big night.

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:17,321
How will you ask her?

6
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,331
It'll be perfect.
We'll go to her favorite restaurant.

7
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:25,442
I'll get her favorite champagne.
She'll know how expensive it is.

8
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:31,968
When the glasses are full, instead
of proposing a toast, I'll propose.

9
00:00:33,572 --> 00:00:34,561
Sounds perfect!

10
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:37,568
You'll mess up.
Let me do it.

11
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:39,287
I won't mess up.

12
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,767
If she says no,
can I have the ring?

13
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:43,321
She won't say no.

14
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:44,966
If?

15
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,405
Hey, Monica.

16
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:56,010
-Give it.
-It's gone.

17
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,090
Hey, Monica!

18
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,964
We're practically kissing.

19
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,562
The One With The Proposal - Part 1

Gelula/SDI

21
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:52,482
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

22
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:55,565
And the more people I bring,
the better I look.

23
00:01:56,652 --> 00:01:59,450
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

24
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:03,167
-Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
-What's the big deal?

25
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:07,965
I get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

26
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:10,607
Where are you going?

27
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:14,723
-How about you guys?
-Open bar?

28
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:18,251
-I think so.
-I can do that for the kids.

29
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:23,485
I'll come. I'm making money.
It's time I give some back.

30
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:26,240
You could give back
the money you owe me.

31
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,328
Okay. Have a benefit.

32
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,011
Ross, can you come
to a charity event tonight?

33
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,129
No, I have plans with Elizabeth.

34
00:02:37,332 --> 00:02:39,971
You're already doing
your part for the kids.

35
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:46,369
It's our last night before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

36
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:50,766
I have a question. All jokes aside.

37
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,604
Where is this relationship going?

38
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:55,764
All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

39
00:02:57,332 --> 00:03:00,404
-Do you see this as long-term?
-I don't know.

40
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:04,765
-You are 1 2 years older than her.
-Does everyone feel this way?

41
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,163
Yeah, sort of.

42
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:12,166
Thought you were making jokes.
I had no idea.

43
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:16,564
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

44
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:20,560
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

45
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:25,004
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

46
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,362
Not what she said last night.

47
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,330
See, now he could date her.

48
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,246
Will you marry me?

49
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,370
Will you marry me?

50
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,369
Hey, you marry me.

51
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,762
What's going on, little elves?

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,562
It's the big night.
We wish you luck.

53
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:56,569
-Have the ring?
-In my pocket.

54
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:09,447
Will you guys get out of here?
This is a surprise.

55
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah, guys. Get out of here.

56
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:15,561
Hi, guys.

57
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:20,764
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

58
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:28,244
What's going on?

59
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:30,091
We're just really. . .

60
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,291
. . .excited about this charity event
we're going to.

61
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:40,565
-Here.
-Thank you.

62
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,689
So, what's going on here?

63
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:44,963
Well, this is a silent auction.

64
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:48,403
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

65
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,483
The highest bid gets it.

66
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:54,480
I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

67
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:57,441
Why?

68
00:04:57,772 --> 00:04:59,763
No, it's nice.

69
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,770
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

70
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,724
Someone? I brought people.

71
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,400
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.

72
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:10,210
He's the head of my department.

73
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:14,366
-And I also brought my friend Joey.
-Shrimp toast!

74
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:18,565
You know, I don't know where he is.

75
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,605
I hope you're gonna bid.

76
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:24,288
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

77
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,760
-Nice choice.
-Yeah.

78
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:28,162
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

79
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:33,764
Okay, $20.

80
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,887
Shut the door! Shut the door!

81
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,201
What's going on?

82
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,408
Guys are throwing water balloons.

83
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:50,361
Call the police. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

84
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:54,161
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

85
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:59,611
I just stopped by to see if you wanted
to see this play tonight.

86
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,008
It's excellent. The director is the--

87
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:05,961
-Who drank all the kamikazes?
-Nobody. We put them in here!

88
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:08,364
You want some?

89
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:14,164
-Could I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah, sure.

90
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,562
So this play, what do you think?

91
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,367
-It's gotten great reviews.
-Attack!

92
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:24,962
-Put your balloons down!
-You put your balloons down!

93
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:29,644
Everybody put their balloons down!

94
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:34,171
Now, this is a nice suit!

95
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,891
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

96
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:45,089
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

97
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,368
So close!

98
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:51,127
Hey, you guys, look.
Got me some drinks.

99
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:55,685
-What are you doing?
-Open bar.

100
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,763
Finally, our biggest item.

101
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:02,363
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

102
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:06,963
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

103
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:08,765
I won!

104
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:12,163
That was my guess!

105
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,007
What? What? What?

106
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:16,368
I guessed $20,000.

107
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:21,362
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

108
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:22,971
What?

109
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,240
I don't have $20,000.

110
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:30,365
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

111
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,851
Joey, sit down.

112
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:38,166
Forget her. You enjoy this.

113
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,490
What are you doing?

114
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:58,565
"One nation. . .

115
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:03,963
. . .under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all. "

116
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,166
I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

117
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,361
-Are you okay?
-Yes. Yes.

118
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,091
I'm good. Are you good?

119
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,163
Are you perfect?

120
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:15,081
Yeah. I'm okay.

121
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:17,971
I'm a little cold.
Can I have your jacket?

122
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,571
No, you can't have my jacket.

123
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,562
Because then I would be cold.

124
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,767
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should have brought a jacket.

125
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,889
Other than that, are you okay?

126
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,571
Are you sure you're okay?

127
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,367
Yes. I'm fine.

128
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:43,481
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think. . .

129
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,085
. . .the reason is you.

130
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,487
That's sweet.

131
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:54,927
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

132
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,403
And I couldn't imagine growing old--

133
00:08:58,692 --> 00:08:59,761
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,367
-I know. But let me say it.
-Oh, my God. Richard.

135
00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,842
What? I'm Chandler.

136
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,525
Oh, that's Richard.

137
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,528
Maybe he won't see us.
Richard!

138
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,608
Monica. Chandler.

139
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,970
I don't know why I did that.

140
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:27,449
-It's good to see you.
-You too. You let your hair grow.

141
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,212
Oh, that's right,
you always wanted me to.

142
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,044
I see your mustache is back.

143
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,363
Well, my nose got lonely.

144
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,526
And you don't have a mustache,
which is good.

145
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,370
I'm Chandler.
I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.

146
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,883
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

147
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:50,771
No one's supposed to know about us!

148
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,369
See, I did it again.

149
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,887
-Chandler, sit down.
-I'll sit down.

150
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,121
Good to see you.

151
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,811
Your table is ready, sir.

152
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,565
Good to see you guys.

153
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,768
If you prefer, this table's available.

154
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,970
That might be fun.

155
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,244
What were you thinking?

156
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,124
I didn't know it was an auction.

157
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,811
I figured I'd take a guess.

158
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,771
Help a charity. Free boat!

159
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,806
Why would a charity
give away a free boat?

160
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,771
I don't know. Charity?

161
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,167
Well, just buy the damn boat.

162
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:34,772
Don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

163
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:37,042
I'm just helping the kids.

164
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,800
How is you drinking helping the kids?

165
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:44,800
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

166
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:51,684
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your contribution brings us. . .

167
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:54,162
. . .a big step closer
to building the youth center.

168
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,486
Just out of curiosity,
how much is that boat worth?

169
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,489
I think it was valued at 1 9,000.

170
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,963
Hey, I was pretty close.

171
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,883
So, bad news.

172
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:11,169
I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

173
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:17,569
Joey! Joey, good one!

174
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,646
Good! Very good!

175
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,281
-So I think I'm gonna take off now.
-You can't leave, Joey!

176
00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:32,365
You agreed to buy that boat.
It is a contract.

177
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:35,046
Plus, if you leave,
my boss is gonna kill me.

178
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,966
I don't have that kind of money.

179
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,804
I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

180
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:41,367
This is what we'll do.

181
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:45,207
We'll go to the next highest bidder,
and we'll let them buy it.

182
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,408
Then you're just gonna
pay the difference.

183
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:48,681
Okay.

184
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,765
I don't know why the kids need a
youth center anyway.

185
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:56,363
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. And I turned out fine.

186
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,287
Not great.

187
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,763
So we're hiding in the bathroom. . . .

188
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,248
Then I sneak out. But before
Monica can, her parents come in.

189
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,363
I hid in the shower,
next thing you know. . .

190
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:10,563
. . .they're going at it on the floor.

191
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:11,921
Oh, my God!

192
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,485
I got a good one.

193
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,645
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

194
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:28,369
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

195
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,889
As a poet once said, "In the sweetness
of friendship. . .

196
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:35,010
. . .Iet there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures. . .

197
00:12:35,652 --> 00:12:37,290
. . .for in the dew of little things. . .

198
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,323
. . .the heart finds its morning and is
refreshed. "

199
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,081
What?

200
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,245
Oh, my God! You guys!

201
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:57,280
Have we got a story for you.
Guess who we bumped into?

202
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,528
-Who?
-Richard!

203
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:04,970
I thought you were going out.

204
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,801
I was. She was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

205
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,328
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

206
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,403
Maybe she is too young for me.

207
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,966
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

208
00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:24,171
I finally see what you were talking
about. I don't know what to do.

209
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:27,682
Just weigh the good stuff about
the relationship against the bad.

210
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,971
That's what I did when I first started
weighing stuff.

211
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:37,568
Okay, bad stuff.
I'm 1 2 years older than she is.

212
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,564
If school finds out, you're fired.

213
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:42,565
-She's leaving for three months.
-For camp.

214
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,361
Okay, good stuff.

215
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:49,045
Well, she's sweet and pretty and. . . .

216
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,807
The only question you need to ask
is, do you see a future?

217
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,006
Do you see yourself marrying her?

218
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:59,609
My God. You married her, didn't you?

219
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:04,768
No, I didn't do that.
It's just. . . .

220
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:10,049
Honestly, no,
I don't see a big future with her.

221
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:13,281
Okay, I think that's your answer.

222
00:14:13,932 --> 00:14:16,287
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.

223
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,847
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful. . .

224
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,289
. . .you may not get married
at all this year.

225
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:30,012
-Next highest bidder is at table one.
-Great.

226
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,085
The guy who got the Paris trip
is at table four.

227
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:36,762
-You care about the guy who won?
-It's a trip for two.

228
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,165
Excuse me.

229
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,967
Is the person who won the
Paris trip at this table?

230
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:50,772
-That was me.
-Enchanté.

231
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:57,967
-Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
-That's me.

232
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:02,927
Hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

233
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:07,241
The Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again.

234
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:10,205
I believe you made a bid of $1 8,000?

235
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,364
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

236
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:19,006
I was actually relieved
I didn't win the boat.

237
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:20,645
My wife would've killed me.

238
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,286
Are you kidding?
She'll love this boat!

239
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,602
-What is your wife's name?
-It's Pam.

240
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:30,209
It's Pam. Just imagine this.
The Pam.

241
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:34,490
I don't think she'd like that.

242
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:39,245
Imagine this:
The Mr. Bowmont.

243
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,881
I don't think so.

244
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:43,367
Let me paint you a little picture.

245
00:15:44,372 --> 00:15:48,490
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your arms.

246
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:54,281
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

247
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,445
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

248
00:15:57,652 --> 00:16:00,883
You get one of those hats,
people call you captain.

249
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,966
And then when you're old, Cappy.

250
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,722
It's for a good cause.
All right!

251
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,366
-No way! It's mine!
-What?

252
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:14,570
The stuff you said, I want that!

253
00:16:14,852 --> 00:16:17,320
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!

254
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:21,047
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!

255
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,247
You're back!

256
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,090
Let me see your hand!

257
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,165
Why do you want to see my hand?

258
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,045
I want to see what's in your hand,
the trash.

259
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,362
It's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

260
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,967
-What did you just do?
-What happened?

261
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,482
-Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
-Oh, no.

262
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:57,731
I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.
Now you've ruined it.

263
00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:58,961
We didn't.

264
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:01,640
You walk in here and
ask to see her hand!

265
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:06,527
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor.

266
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,607
-Glove salesman.
-Good one!

267
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,208
This is terrible.
What am I gonna do?

268
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:18,650
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

269
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:22,128
I'll make her think marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

270
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,892
Convince her you're scared
of commitment.

271
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,560
I can do that.
I've had 30 years of practice.

272
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:30,571
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

273
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,691
Had to go to the basement. . .

274
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:37,368
. . .some idiot keeps stuffing
the chute with pizza boxes.

275
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,167
That guy's still doing that?

276
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,771
My God, let me see your hand!

277
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:48,163
No, you're too late!
She already took out the trash!

278
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:01,605
I have never had
such a healthy breakup.

279
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:05,003
She was such a grownup about it.

280
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:08,369
She didn 't seem too immature for me.

281
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,169
Did ljust make a huge mistake?

282
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:13,845
Ross? Wait!

283
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,362
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about--

284
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:18,561
You suck!

285
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:20,681
What?

286
00:18:28,332 --> 00:18:30,766
Breakup's still on.

287
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,561
Here she comes.

288
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:42,332
Do I look like
I don't want to get married?

289
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,606
And, also, a little like a
French guy.

290
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,404
I never noticed that before.

291
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:55,721
What are you up to?

292
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:59,363
Just hanging out.
Talking about web sites.

293
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,165
We saw this interesting web site
about marriage.

294
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,403
How unnecessary it is.

295
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,285
How it's a way for governments
to keep tabs on you.

296
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,164
Yeah, Big Brother.

297
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,805
That's a little crazy.

298
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:18,170
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the lnternet.

299
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:23,403
Got me thinking,
why would anybody want to get married?

300
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,922
To celebrate the relationship.
To solidify the commitment.

301
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,805
To declare your love for one another
to the world.

302
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:35,484
Well, that's good to know.

303
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,168
The Mr. Bowmont's here!

304
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:49,283
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

305
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:51,767
Sure! I love this part!

306
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,727
-Come on in.
-Hi.

307
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:59,088
I'm not here to compliment the chef.

308
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,967
I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

309
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:05,163
Like I've nothing better to do.

310
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:07,481
What's up?

311
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,604
It was great seeing you
the other night.

312
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:12,291
Good to see you too.

313
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,405
