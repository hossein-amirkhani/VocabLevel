1
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:05,048
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:07,947
Honey, I got us that room at the
Woodford lnn this weekend.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,920
That place in Vermont?
You can take a hint.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,650
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.

5
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:16,157
We're having a party.

6
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:18,387
Can't you have the party
when we get back?

7
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:21,560
No. It won't be her real birthday.

8
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:27,000
Gee, if only she were 1 and had
no idea what the hell a birthday was.

9
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,797
Come on, you guys,
this is really important to us.

10
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,967
Sorry, but Chandler and l
could really use a weekend away...

11
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:37,206
- ...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.

12
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,316
I read about it in <i>Maxim</i>.

13
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:43,477
Well, can't you just go
to Vermont the next day?

14
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:45,384
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

15
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:50,756
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.

16
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,557
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.

17
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:57,259
How can we have her first birthday party
without her aunt and her uncle?

18
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:01,372
I promise I won't do any magic.

19
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,208
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.

20
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:10,746
Fine. But if we end up not doing
this <i>Maxim</i> thing because of this party--

21
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,441
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.

22
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,929
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...

23
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:09,267
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.

24
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,410
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.

25
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:15,708
I love family traditions like that.

26
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:19,042
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...

27
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:23,483
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.

28
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,557
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

29
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:30,786
- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
- Oh, good!

30
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:33,453
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...

31
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:36,362
- ...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
- Oh, cool.

32
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,867
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:39,037 --> 00:02:42,529
Oh, just think, she's gonna be
watching that video on a TV...

34
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:46,075
...that hasn't even been invented yet...

35
00:02:46,244 --> 00:02:49,805
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.

36
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,849
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...

37
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,646
...to escape the ant people.

38
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,354
That's the hope.

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,488
- So is Emma awake yet?
- No, it's still naptime.

40
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:06,426
- But she'll be up soon.
- Where's Joey?

41
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:08,828
I said, it's still naptime.

42
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:13,203
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.

43
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:16,363
Hey, say something to Emma
on her 1 8th birthday.

44
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:21,212
- Eighteen, huh?
- Joey, no!

45
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,940
What? What? It's for her hot friends.

46
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,244
When they see this, you'll be 52.

47
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,616
And starting to think about
settling down.

48
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:34,190
Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?

49
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,318
Love to. Yeah.

50
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:41,428
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,864
Oh, yeah.
How was I supposed to know?

52
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:47,300
- Joey, it's a birthday party.
- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.

53
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:52,068
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for an hour at a cup.

54
00:03:52,244 --> 00:03:56,078
Just a cup with a picture
of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.

55
00:03:56,248 --> 00:04:01,948
And he's standing next to this cow,
and the cow says, "El-moo."

56
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,316
Man, that's a funny cup.

57
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,255
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:16,298
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.

59
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:21,371
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,408
I know you guys really want to get to
Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.

61
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:29,604
But it really is to us, okay? Emma
will never have a first birthday again.

62
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:31,912
You're right. We're sorry.

63
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,347
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!

64
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:37,147
She didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.

65
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,722
Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?

66
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,188
- Hi!
- Hey!

67
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:49,629
- I'm so glad you came.
- I can't believe Emma's already 1.

68
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,031
I remember your first birthday.

69
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,173
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.

70
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,434
He pulled on his testicles so hard...

71
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,579
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.

72
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,680
There's something you didn't know
about your dad.

73
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,755
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.

74
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:15,017
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?

75
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:18,754
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?

76
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,390
If we gave this present to Emma
from all of us.

77
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:26,861
Which one are you?

78
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:36,407
- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
- I know. What are we gonna do?

79
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,446
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

80
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:44,088
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.

81
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:48,588
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.

82
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,893
I'm not going to Vermont
with this Monica.

83
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:54,927
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

84
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
I was thinking
since you wrote a song...

85
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,103
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.

86
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,866
So you're gonna hit on her?

87
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,535
No, no, no. My talents as an actor.

88
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:09,839
You know, I could, like, maybe....

89
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:13,314
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.

90
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:16,750
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

91
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:20,522
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- Oh, Emma might like what?

92
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:23,252
- My present.
- What did you get her?

93
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:26,192
- We prepared performances.
- Separate performances.

94
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,594
But equally real.

95
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,701
That sounds like fun.

96
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:35,602
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.

97
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:38,140
So would you mind
performing them once now?

98
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,902
- Sure, yeah!
- Okay.

99
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,639
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started.

100
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,750
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.

101
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,579
Oh, great.

102
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,586
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?

103
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:56,386
I do it every week with three cameras
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.

104
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,162
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

105
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:04,564
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.

106
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:08,035
Oh, okay. Which one?

107
00:07:08,206 --> 00:07:10,970
Well, it's one of her favorites.

108
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,809
"<i>Riding the Storm Out:</i>
<i>Coping With Postpartum Depression</i>."

112

A mother held her new baby
and very slowly rocked him...

00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:47,101
...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.

114

And while she held him, she sang,
'I'll love you forever.

115
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:56,947
I'll like you for always.

Oh, wow!

122
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:19,342
That was amazing.

123
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:22,446
Thank you so much for that gift.

124
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:26,478
I was not ready for this today.

125
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:30,647
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

126
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,518
- Phoebe has prepared something as well.
- That's right.

127
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:37,593
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.

128
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:42,426
For there's no greater gift
than the gift of music.

No, of course not.

00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,638
Hello, Emma. Happy 1 8th birthday.

139
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,975
Right now, that seems
so far away, 17 years.

140
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,144
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be....

141
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,755
Well, your grandfather and l
might not be here.

142
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:42,324
That's true. This message
could be coming to you...

143
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:45,088
...from beyond the grave, Emma.

144
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:51,065
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.

145
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:56,301
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.

146
00:09:56,474 --> 00:10:00,274
Okay, cut! Great. Great.
That was just....

147
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,640
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

148
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:05,305
Ross, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.

149
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,474
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.

150
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:11,782
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.

151
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:15,255
Oh, my God, that place has
the creamiest frosting!

152
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,690
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.

153
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:23,297
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...

154
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:27,905
...in all different shapes. And if you give
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.

155
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:32,372
- Did you do a picture of Emma?
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

156
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:36,378
Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...

157
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,106
...erotic cakes?

158
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,011
Say, for bachelorette parties?

159
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:45,315
Ross, what are you talking--?
Oh, my God!

160
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,890
They put my baby's face on a penis!

161
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,826
Now it's a party!

162
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,634
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.

163
00:10:56,801 --> 00:11:00,134
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!

164
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,472
Is it okay that I still think
it looks delicious?

165
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,979
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.

166
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,414
The resemblance is uncanny.

167
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:20,580
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.

168
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:25,492
Ironically, that was the <i>Maxim</i> thing.

169
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:30,593
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
okay?

170
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:34,704
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...

171
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:38,842
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!

172
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,878
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

173
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:45,709
...so we could put it on the bunny.

174
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,511
That is a weird sentence.

175
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,990
Oh, believe you me,
I am going to bring this cake back.

176
00:11:53,157 --> 00:11:55,455
I don't even want it in my home.
Don't touch it!

177
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,618
I'm so confused!

178
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,288
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!

179
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,992
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!

180
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,000
To be fair, this one does have nuts.

181
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,611
Mon, it was nice of you
to loan Rachel your car...

182
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:20,114
- ...so she could get the cake.
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...

183
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:21,912
...till I dropped the key.

184
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,051
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...

185
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:29,682
...for her 1 8th birthday, huh? Okay?

186
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,591
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.

187
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:34,629
Are you still enjoying your nap?

188
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,469
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.

189
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:41,969
You may not recognize us...

190
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,632
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.

191
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,141
We used to be married.

192
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:51,146
But then we missed a weekend away
together, and things kind of unraveled...

193
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,807
...because of you.

194
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:57,512
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks. Another good one.

195
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,455
I can't believe I taped over
my <i>Big Brother</i> audition for this.

196
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:05,093
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.

197
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,754
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.

198
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:12,096
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.

199
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,864
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.

200
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,701
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.

201
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,436
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?

202
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,944
All right, five more minutes.

203
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:27,976
Hello?

204
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:30,154
Oh, no, what happened?

205
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,085
Okay, okay, where are you?

206
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:35,384
Okay, I'll be right there.

207
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,152
Was that Emma? Is she up?

208
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,363
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.

209
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,965
She forgot her license.
I have to bring it to her.

210
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:48,195
- If you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!

211
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,568
We've been complaining the longest!

212
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:54,106
No, wait, you guys.
No, you can't leave.

213
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:56,712
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.

214
00:13:56,881 --> 00:14:00,009
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?

215
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,778
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.

216
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:07,919
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.

217
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:09,992
Got it!

218
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,197
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

219
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:14,729
To the bathroom.

220
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,336
Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
because we are gonna be here for a--

221
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:24,703
- Wait, there's a window in there.
- No! He's not getting away that easy!

222
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:29,110
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

223
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,480
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.

224
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,351
- No, it did not.
- No.

225
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:43,619
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.

226
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:47,287
Jack can't drive at night anymore.
He has trouble staying in his lane.

227
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:51,424
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.

228
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:53,968
The papers thought it was
a hate crime.

229
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:00,467
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.

230
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:02,806
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Nighty-night.

231
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,175
- Nighty-night.
- Bye.

232
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:07,943
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey, hey.

233
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:12,021
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.

234
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,591
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
a Quaker to get out of Korea.

235
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:22,198
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in.

236
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,893
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?

237
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,561
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.

238
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,405
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

239
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:39,812
- Hey.
- <i>So how'd your audition go today?</i>

240
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:43,283
- What audition?
- The one I told you about last week.

241
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:46,582
What? You never said anything
about an audition.

242
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:53,855
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.

243
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,633
<i>I think you can still make it.</i>

244
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:00,794
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
need to have a monologue prepared.

245
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:03,732
A monologue? I don't have a--

246
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,106
I got it.

247
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:12,274
So I'm gonna take off.

248
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,078
- What?
- No, wait! You don't get to leave.

249
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:18,347
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.

250
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:21,515
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!

251
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:23,216
Well, okay, now...

252
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:25,862
...only one of us has to stay
with Emma.

253
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,361
Okay, and as the person
who realized that, I get to go.

254
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,468
No, no, no. No. No.

255
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:34,537
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.

256
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,730
Oh, I got it.

257
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,968
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to 10, all right?

258
00:16:40,144 --> 00:16:42,669
Whoever gets the highest number
gets to go first.

259
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,282
- Okay, 10.
- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.

260
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:48,816
Anyone else?

261
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:52,652
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.

262
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:55,155
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer--

263
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,886
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Right.

264
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:01,554
Okay, how about this?
We got wind-up toys for Emma.

265
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:05,133
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.

266
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:07,567
Yeah, let's do that!

267
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,639
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!

268
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:14,637
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- Okay. I want the dolphin!

269
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:17,940
- That's a bear!
- I'm too excited!

270
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:21,484
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.

271
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,677
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.

272
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:28,291
And the race is going to go
from here to here.

273
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:31,690
Now, the one who comes in last stays!

274
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:34,023
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.

275
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:38,430
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!

276
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,969
Come on, robot!

277
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:45,506
What are you barking at?

278
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:52,814
Well, how is that gonna help?

279
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:57,018
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?

280
00:17:57,288 --> 00:17:59,518
Way to go, robot!

281
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:02,349
Good job, Alan.

282
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:05,093
- Hey, good race, you guys.
- Yeah, see you later.

283
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,253
No. No, no. Wait.

284
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:08,898
We didn't lose.

285
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:13,600
The rules clearly stated that the last one
to cross the finish line was the loser.

286
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,968
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically--

287
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:19,109
They left.

288
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:27,676
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're gonna come home.

289
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:30,518
Everybody left?

290
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:36,452
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.

291
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:39,329
- Rachel!
- Oh, God, sorry!

292
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,955
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.

293
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:48,069
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?

294
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,900
I can't believe this.

295
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,532
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
we're not even there.

296
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:56,942
Everybody left. We still have
this stupid obscene cake.

297
00:18:57,114 --> 00:19:00,675
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.

298
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:03,513
Oh, don't even bother.

299
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:06,122
We've already ruined
her first birthday.

300
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,522
And do you know how important these
early experiences are, Ross? Very!

301
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:13,721
According to the back cover
of that book that you gave me.

302
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:17,265
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

303
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:20,530
I guess.

304
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:27,037
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?

305
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,372
Emma laughing...

306
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:33,711
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."

307
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:38,719
And then we would all-- Hey, get out
of the road, you stupid student driver!

308
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,422
They have to learn.

309
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,727
- Hey.
- What?

310
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,989
This is not bad.

311
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:52,966
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?

312
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:56,197
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.

313
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:01,734
And then I split this to make ears.

314
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,543
Well, I am very impressed.

315
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,580
Some can sing, some can dance.

316
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:10,312
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.

317
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:17,093
Now, another way to organize
your stuffed animals is by size.

318
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:20,321
I'm sorry, is this a game
for Emma or for Monica?

319
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:23,160
Game?

320
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:27,703
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're 1.

321
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,670
One year old. That's little.

322
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:35,772
That's my girl.

323
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,946
That's how old you are.

324
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:42,552
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?

325
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,716
I want one.

326
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:49,983
Me too.

327
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,223
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?

328
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:00,828
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.

329
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,495
I wasn't. Let's get going.

330
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:07,209
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.

331
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:11,075
- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
- What about your massage client?

332
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:16,208
I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
slipped him a little something, you know.

333
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:19,584
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.

334
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,092
Okay.

335
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,526
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.

336
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,090
I've been here the whole time.

337
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:35,662
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.

338
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:40,735
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.

339
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:43,669
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.

340
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:46,112
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?

341
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:48,080
How old are you today?

342
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:55,085
Emma, that's right. You're that many.

343
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:58,023
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.

344
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,993
- This means--
- No! No science camp!

345
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:05,761
Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.

346
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:11,806
Oh, and, Emma, look at your
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.

347
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:13,941
Thanks.

348
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:17,376
Okay, here we go.

349
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:22,082
Emma's first birthday cake.

350
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,750
Go ahead, Emma,
blow out the candle.

351
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:27,516
Come on, Emma. You can do it.

352
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:30,785
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.

353
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:33,521
These are happy tears.

354
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:35,995
This is just what I wanted.

355
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,464
Hey, you made it into a bunny.

356
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:45,063
What is wrong with me? It looked
more delicious when it was a penis.

357
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,042
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

358
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:54,707
- And record.
- Okay.

359
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:57,251
<i>Big Brother</i> audition. Take one.

360
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:59,912
I guess you could say
I'm kind of a player.

361
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,081
Okay. Let's--

362
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,954
- Let's just try that again.
- Okay.

363
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:11,900
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and--

364
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:14,196
Go! Go! Come on!

365
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:16,839
Go! Go! Come on!

366
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:21,239
Go! Go, Alan!
Run, you hairy bastard!
