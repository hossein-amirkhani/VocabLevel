1
00:00:02,481 --> 00:00:04,278
- Hey, guys--
- Wait! Let me tell them.

2
00:00:04,483 --> 00:00:05,882
- Sure.
- Joey's gonna be...

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:08,383
...a celebrity guest on a game show.

4
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,885
Really? Which one?

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,281
Fish. Seaweed.

6
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,552
- A sunken ship.
- Things you find in the ocean.

7
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,788
- You're gonna be on <i>Pyramid</i>!
- Yeah.

8
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:23,025
- That was our favorite game show ever.
- Except for <i>Match Game</i>.

9
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,793
Or <i>Win, Lose or Draw</i>.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,935
What did I marry into?

11
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:33,373
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?

12
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,241
Oh, we can't. We're throwing Phoebe
a bachelorette party.

13
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:39,578
Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.

14
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:44,551
And Chandler and I have this stupid
college alumni thing.

15
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,556
I can't believe you get
to meet Donny Osmond.

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,890
Seriously?

17
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:56,227
Ross and I always wanted to be
Donny and Marie.

18
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,733
You guys just keep getting
cooler and cooler.

19
00:01:00,472 --> 00:01:02,963
Yeah, we used to perform
for our family and friends.

20
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:07,043
Oh, God, that's right.
I blocked that out.

21
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,216
I'm leaving you.

22
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:12,436
It's so weird to see
all these people again.

23
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,602
Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.

24
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,375
- Who?
- He was roommates with John Rosoff.

25
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,842
He went out with Andrea Tamborino.

26
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:25,788
She dumped him for Michael Skloff.

27
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,787
Did I go to this school?

28
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:34,428
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
You gotta remember her.

29
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,499
Sure. Nice.

30
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,636
Dude, you're married to my sister.

31
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:41,772
You're right. By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.

32
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:47,139
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?

33
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:49,473
Are you asking permission
to break the pact?

34
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:51,616
Yes, please.

35
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:07,022
Hey. Hey, check out
the fliers for the band.

36
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,395
- I made them on a Macintosh.
- Awesome.

37
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,161
The name really stands out.

38
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:17,036
Thanks to a little something called
Helvetica Bold 24-point.

39
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,910
Man, we're gonna rock
that Asian Student Union.

40
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,214
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Missy.

41
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:30,218
- Our band is playing on Friday.
- Yeah, you should come check us out.

42
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:32,822
We're called Way/No Way.

43
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:36,252
- No way.
- Way.

44
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:38,896
- Great. I'll be there.
- Fresh.

45
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:40,361
- Boss.
- Mint.

46
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,557
- She's gone.
- I know it.

47
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:48,438
- I am totally gonna ask her out.
- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.

48
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:53,010
- I said it first, bro.
- Well, I thought it first, Homes.

49
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:57,405
- Look, if you date--
- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?

50
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,916
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.

51
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,612
I mean, we can get laid
any time we want.

52
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,256
Totally.

53
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:10,451
- I had sex in high school.
- Me too. I'm good at it.

54
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,595
All right, I say we make a pact.

55
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:17,530
Neither of us will go out
with Missy Goldberg.

56
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,863
You got it.

57
00:04:20,872 --> 00:04:23,602
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...

58
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,209
- ...who we can't go out with.
- Those are the pacts.

59
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:29,870
And Sheena Easton. But we probably
couldn't get her anyway.

60
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:32,278
Maybe not you.

61
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,653
Well, I officially give you permission
to break the pact.

62
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:38,220
Thank you.

63
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:46,657
Here I go. Hey, remember how scary
it used to be going up to girls in college?

64
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:50,460
- Your hands are shaking.
- I know. And I can't stop sweating.

65
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,629
Five, four, three. Applause.

66
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:01,578
Yeah!

67
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,715
Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
here on <i>Pyramid</i>.

68
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:08,580
Let's meet our contestants. First,
Gene Lester is a database specialist.

69
00:05:08,753 --> 00:05:12,814
He's gonna be playing with
<i>Days of Our Lives</i> star Joey Tribbiani.

70
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,586
And over here,
we have Henrietta Cherry.

71
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:21,493
I know it can be intimidating for
regular people to be around celebrities...

72
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,932
...but relax. I'm just like you,
only better-looking and richer.

73
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:30,440
She'll be playing with star of
<i>General Hospital</i>, Leslie Charleson.

74
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,470
Welcome, everybody. Good luck
to all of you. Let's play <i>Pyramid</i>.

75
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:39,276
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
before the show.

76
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:42,249
Gene, you won the toss,
so you'll start. Which category?

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,253
- "You Crossed the Line."
- "You Crossed the Line." Joey...

78
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,586
...describe for Gene these things
that have lines.

79
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,661
Give me 20 seconds on the clock,
please. Ready? Go.

80
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:56,164
Okay, it's a store like a supermarket.

81
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:00,634
I see what I did there. Okay, okay.
I'm writing in my....

82
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:03,433
- Diary.
- No, more like a notebook.

83
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,971
If I'm building a house, the plan...

84
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:12,173
...isn't called a "shmooprint" ....

85
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,714
I can't do that either?

86
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:19,421
In high school, I once had sex
with a girl right in the middle of the...?

87
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:22,992
- Cafeteria?
- Yeah, but they're not looking for that.

88
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:30,857
- Thank you so much for this.
- You like it?

89
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:34,233
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.

90
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,601
When's the dirty stuff starting?

91
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:40,868
- What?
- The strippers and the guys dancing...

92
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:43,606
...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.

93
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:50,613
Pheebs, l.... There isn't gonna be
any "flying about."

94
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,986
We thought we were
a little too mature for stuff like that.

95
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,291
Oh, okay.

96
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:01,354
I see what you're doing. That's fine.
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.

97
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,302
Raunchy.

98
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:11,769
Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
that kind of a party.

99
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,274
Really? So this is...?

100
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,041
This is my big sendoff into married life?

101
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:21,276
Rachel, this is the only
bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.

102
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,580
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.

103
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:30,152
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?

104
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,088
No.

105
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:37,626
- Phoebe, of course there's more.
- Okay.

106
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:40,896
I mean, let me just go talk to Monica...

107
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,768
...and get an ETA on the pee-pees.

108
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,642
We've got a problem.

109
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:52,749
Oh, my God. Did someone find
my Band-Aid in their scone?

110
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,613
That wasn't an apricot?

111
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:01,681
- What's the problem?
- Okay. Phoebe wants a stripper.

112
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,760
I thought we said
we were too grown up for that.

113
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:07,022
Yeah, well, it's what she wants.

114
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:15,397
Hey, why is the page
that has strippers on it dog-eared?

115
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:18,905
Chandler was in Tulsa. I was bored.

116
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:20,601
Please don't tell him.

117
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,110
Now, Gene, I must remind you, you need
all six of these to stay in the game.

118
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:31,415
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."

119
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,116
They might as well
just give us the points.

120
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,126
Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
Ready? Go.

121
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,767
- You put this in your coffee.
- A spoon. Your hands. Your face.

122
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:46,700
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

123
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:50,807
- It's heavier than milk.
- A rock. A dog. The Earth.

124
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:51,964
Pass.

125
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,973
- You put it on a sandwich.
- Salami. Anchovies. Jam.

126
00:08:56,147 --> 00:08:59,674
- It's white.
- Paper. Snow. A ghost!

127
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:02,580
- It's made from eggs.
- Chickens?

128
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:04,119
Pass.

129
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,220
- You put this on a hamburger.
- Ketchup! Relish!

130
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:08,791
Stop!

131
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:12,860
Oh, time's up. Well, Joey, you were...

132
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:16,489
...almost on a roll there. Gene...

133
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:19,728
...you'll have a chance to go to
the Winner's Circle, but now...

134
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:24,739
...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's
Circle to try your luck for $ 10,000...

135
00:09:24,909 --> 00:09:27,173
...right after this. Don't go away.

136
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:29,673
And we're out.

137
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:34,410
- How about that ketchup thing, huh?
- Yeah. Impressive.

138
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:38,750
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?

139
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:42,716
I got a kid starting college.
I have to get surgery on my knee.

140
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,589
You just lost me 10 grand.

141
00:09:45,263 --> 00:09:47,424
Oh, wow.

142
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:51,591
I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise,
we'll do better next time.

143
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,499
Well, I will, because I won't be
playing with you.

144
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:57,868
Hey, some of those are pretty hard.

145
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:01,336
Like, why would there be
a ghost in my fridge?

146
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:04,843
Yeah.

147
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,547
- So Saturday night?
- I'd love to.

148
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,278
Great.

149
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,482
So how come it took you so long
to ask me out?

150
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,992
Oh, well, this is gonna sound
kind of silly...

151
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:21,155
...but do you remember
my roommate, Chandler Bing?

152
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,698
Sure. He was in your "band."

153
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:30,337
It's been 16 years,
but the air quotes still hurt.

154
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:32,271
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Anyway....

155
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:35,810
Well, he and I both
really liked you a lot...

156
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,814
...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
our friendship, so we made a pact...

157
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,452
...that neither of us could ask you out.

158
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,311
- Really?
- Yeah, why?

159
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,017
Well, Chandler and I used to make out.

160
00:10:49,194 --> 00:10:51,162
A lot.

161
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:55,223
- You did?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,632
- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
- And on my turf?!

163
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:06,399
Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.

164
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,706
He's coming from Jersey. He said
he'd get here as fast as he could.

165
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:15,513
Oh, by the way, Phoebe's friend Marge
found an earring in cucumber sandwich.

166
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,414
Well, it's not mi--

167
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:22,820
I am not on my game today.

168
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,726
- Who is it?
- It's the police.

169
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:28,729
The police!

170
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:35,465
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.

171
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,632
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?

172
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,785
That's a lot of stairs.

173
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,052
Boy.

174
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,595
You should warn people
there's no elevator.

175
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:07,128
I should not have had
that Mexican food for lunch.

176
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,539
Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?

177
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:14,803
- Goodbody.
- If you say so.

178
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:19,606
So where's the young lady...

179
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:24,350
...who I am supposed to take
downtown?

180
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,892
Oh, God.

181
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:36,533
You, my dear, are under arrest.

182
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,929
Cardiac arrest?

183
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:43,806
All right. Somebody show me
where to plug in my box...

184
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,967
...and we'll get this party started.

185
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,212
- Over here?
- Yeah.

186
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:53,543
- All right.
- Rachel?

187
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:57,221
- Yeah?
- Are you kidding?

188
00:12:57,388 --> 00:13:00,323
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
so we got the phone book...

189
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,621
- ...and got the first name we could find.
- How old's your phone book?

190
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,596
Oh, my God, this man is gonna
get naked in my apartment.

191
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,565
God, no. I don't wanna see him
take his clothes off.

192
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:14,705
Are you talking about me?

193
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,537
No.

194
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:22,009
I mean, obviously we wanna see you
take your clothes off.

195
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,705
You big piece of eye candy.

196
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:31,680
Okay. Okay, ladies,
can I have your attention, please?

197
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:33,652
Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:41,492
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

199
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:48,261
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.

200
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:56,542
I hope you're familiar
with this state's penal code.

201
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,917
Okay, okay. Enough teasing.

202
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:04,282
Now for some pleasing.

203
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,675
She cringed.

204
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:40,248
This is how I look when I'm turned-on.

205
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,027
You were talking about me before.

206
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:47,756
Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here.
Where's my hat?

207
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,731
Look, I've been in this business
for a long time.

208
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:54,633
Shocking.

209
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,804
Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
I'll be on my way.

210
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,946
- $300? Are you kidding?
- That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.

211
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,480
You're not gonna pay him.
He didn't do anything.

212
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,780
Didn't do anything? I took a bus
all the way from Hoboken.

213
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:13,446
I climbed, I don't know,
like, a billion stairs.

214
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:16,422
And it's not like I can
take them two at a time.

215
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:22,730
I don't care.
We're not paying you $300 for this.

216
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,630
It's not my fault if you're
too uptight to appreciate...

217
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:28,670
...the male form in all its glory.

218
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:32,672
Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
wanna watch a middle-aged guy...

219
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:37,747
...dance around in what I can only
assume is a child's Halloween costume.

220
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,581
I may have borrowed this
from my nephew...

221
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:48,953
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.

222
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:52,118
I'm sorry, did you say "all man"
or "old man"?

223
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,064
You're mean.

224
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,328
- Look, officer-- Sir?
- Damn it.

225
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:06,837
Big surprise.
The hunk of beef has feelings.

226
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,348
Applause.

227
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:15,316
Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."

228
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:18,478
My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.

229
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:23,252
Joey, describe these things associated
with the United States Congress.

230
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,421
Give me 20 seconds
on the clock, please.

231
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,897
Ready? Go.

232
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Pass.

233
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,099
Pass.

234
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,712
Pass.

235
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:47,283
- The thing hanging in your throat.
- Uvula.

236
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,016
Then pass.

237
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:53,882
Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
all the points you needed...

238
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:58,757
...so that means, Gene, you are going to
the Winner's Circle to try for $ 10,000.

239
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,764
And you're gonna be going there
with Joey Tribbiani.

240
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,694
Pass.

241
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,739
Nope. You must be thinking
of someone else.

242
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,934
I was never in a band.

243
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:16,337
You made out with Missy Goldberg?

244
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:19,449
How could you do that
after you promised me?

245
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,149
Excuse me.

246
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,422
That didn't make us sound gay at all.

247
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,787
- You broke the pact.
- Ross, that was 16 years ago.

248
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,487
That doesn't matter. We're talking
about the foundation of our friendship.

249
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:36,622
I believe the foundation of our friendship
was unfortunate hair.

250
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:42,398
If we're really gonna do this, it's not
like you never broke one of the pacts.

251
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:44,097
- I didn't.
- Oh, really?

252
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,640
- No.
- Oh, really?

253
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,437
- No.
- Adrienne Turner.

254
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,170
Yes?

255
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,444
- Hey, Adrienne.
- Hey, Adrienne. Hey.

256
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,481
I never did anything
with Adrienne Turner.

257
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:58,918
Oh, please. And you knew
how much I liked her.

258
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,058
I don't know what you're talking about.

259
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:03,159
Really? Remember
that party freshman year?

260
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,921
A week before Christmas vacation? I do.

261
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,463
You had some visitors.

262
00:18:14,939 --> 00:18:17,669
I can't believe we're
at a real college party.

263
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,140
I have to pee so bad.

264
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,506
This is so awesome.

265
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,978
College guys are so cute.

266
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,709
- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
- I know.

267
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:32,981
But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim
wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.

268
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,187
Hey, look, there's Chandler.

269
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,861
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.

270
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:46,026
- I've already lost four pounds.
- You can so totally tell.

271
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:48,034
I know!

272
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,864
Well, let's see,
maybe he knows where Ross is.

273
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,910
Hey, how's it going?

274
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,479
- Aren't you...?
- Yeah, Rachel.

275
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:02,551
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.

276
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,813
Right. So how you doing?

277
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,547
Bitchen.

278
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,718
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi, Chandler.

279
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:13,091
It's really nice to see you. Not!

280
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:16,756
Okay.

281
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:19,095
I'll see if I can find Ross.

282
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,361
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.

283
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:27,271
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.

284
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:35,582
Listen, Adrienne,
you can't tell Chandler about this.

285
00:19:35,753 --> 00:19:40,019
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.

286
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,052
Cool.

287
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:50,865
No way.

288
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,602
I didn't know you knew about that.

289
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,401
Well, I did. And it hurt.

290
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:03,172
That's when I wrote the song
"Betrayal in the Common Room."

291
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:09,317
That's why that song had
so much power.

292
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:18,019
Man, I'm sorry.

293
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:21,392
Look, that was a long time ago.

294
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:26,264
So I made out with Adrienne,
and you made out with Missy.

295
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,664
Well, I guess we're even.

296
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:35,439
We are even, right?

297
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:42,178
One more thing. I was so pissed at you
that night, I wanted to get back at you.

298
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:45,720
So I thought, "Who does Ross
like more than anybody?"

299
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:51,020
What did you do to my mom?

300
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,926
Not her.

301
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:14,541
I am so drunk.

302
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:20,690
That's weird. I've had the same number
of beers as you and don't feel anything.

303
00:21:21,158 --> 00:21:23,023
So you girls having fun?

304
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:25,355
For your information, ass-munch...

305
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:30,190
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five with all the dancing.

306
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:34,603
- Somebody order a pizza?
- Oh, that's me!

307
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:42,208
I am so not gonna do good
on my SATs tomorrow.

308
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,982
Well, maybe you could go to school here
next year and we could totally hang out.

309
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:48,708
Oh, yeah. There's a plan.

310
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:52,287
Why don't I just start taking
my smart pills now.

311
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,118
Well, maybe you could get in
on a beauty scholarship.

312
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,223
What a line.

313
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,325
- So where are you applying to?
- Well...

314
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:09,632
...l think it's kind of really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun.

315
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,707
So I'm sort of-- Hey!

316
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,670
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.

317
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,747
Yeah, okay.

318
00:22:22,686 --> 00:22:27,316
What's the matter? You never saw
a 50-year-old stripper cry before?

319
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,922
You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.

320
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:34,326
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?

321
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:38,400
I should have hung up
that breakaway jockstrap years ago.

322
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:45,273
Half the time, it just pops off by itself.

323
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:51,444
Maybe now is a good time
for cake and presents.

324
00:22:51,882 --> 00:22:54,646
What am I gonna do? I mean...

325
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:57,548
...this has been my life for 32 years.

326
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:01,919
Taking my clothes off
in front of people is all I know.

327
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,193
No, there's got to be something else
that you can do.

328
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,887
I mean, what skills do you have?

329
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,896
I don't know.

330
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,561
I can make my pecs dance.

331
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:20,907
I can pick up a dollar bill
with my butt cheeks.

332
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:27,414
I can go to that special place
inside me where I feel no shame.

333
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:32,048
So maybe something in an office.

334
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,792
Or you could-- You could teach stripping.

335
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,293
You know, share your gift.
Pass the torch.

336
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:43,992
You know, actually,
that's not a bad idea.

337
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:48,537
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.

338
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:52,200
There you go. Okay.
You think you're gonna be okay?

339
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,401
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

340
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,808
This is so weird.

341
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:59,506
You never know when it's gonna be
your last dance.

342
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,877
And I didn't even get a chance
to finish it.

343
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,014
Finish it.

344
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:14,164
- What?
- Your last dance. Do it for us.

345
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:18,062
- Really?
- Really?

346
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:24,464
Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
the thing he loves one last time.

347
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:28,440
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.

348
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:30,477
Okay.

349
00:25:02,813 --> 00:25:05,077
Oh, this is so hot!

350
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,855
Oh, no, don't stop.

351
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:14,081
Have to.

352
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:20,823
I am so sorry that you have
to do this with me.

353
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:24,490
Listen, I know this won't
put your kid through college...

354
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:27,262
...but would you like
a <i>Days of our Lives</i> mug?

355
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,100
We're back in five, four,
three, two....

356
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:32,003
Applause.

357
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:35,876
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?

358
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:38,378
- Yeah.
- Sure.

359
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,951
Okay. Give me 60 seconds
on the clock, please.

360
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,951
Ready? Go.

361
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:49,114
Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.

362
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,124
I don't know. Types of trees...?

363
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:57,394
<i>Buenos d</i>i<i>as.</i> Enchilada. <i>Por favor.</i>

364
00:25:57,568 --> 00:26:00,469
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I don't know any Spanish words.

365
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,263
A match. A candle.

366
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,432
Things that go:
when you put them out.

367
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,838
A torch. A bonfire.

368
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:11,810
- Your pee.
- Things that burn.

369
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,513
"I'd like to go for a walk."
"Scratch my belly."

370
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:18,621
Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.

371
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,519
"I have fur." "I like to bark."

372
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:22,954
What a dog says.

373
00:26:24,628 --> 00:26:26,118
- Pepperoni.
- Pizza toppings!

374
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,295
Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum.

375
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,135
Claudia Schiffer. Christy Turlington.
Kate Moss.

376
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,603
Girls Chandler could never get?

377
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:39,867
- Supermodels.
- Where?

378
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:46,473
I can't believe you're so upset.

379
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,550
What do you mean?
You kissed Rachel.

380
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:52,416
Ross, she was so drunk
she didn't even remember it the next day.

381
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:55,251
Plus, I should tell you,
it did not last long.

382
00:26:58,428 --> 00:26:59,486
Hey!

383
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,462
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.

384
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah, okay.

385
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:16,372
And now I've killed one.

386
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:22,574
Hey. Where's Rachel?

387
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:25,551
She and Phoebe took the stripper
to the hospital.

388
00:27:27,457 --> 00:27:30,949
Sounds like your elegant tea party
went off just as planned.

389
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:33,459
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

390
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:35,723
What? When was this?

391
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,867
Last week. We had some wine and....

392
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,831
You don't know I'm kidding.

393
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,431
1987.

394
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,100
The weekend you guys
visited me at school.

395
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:51,770
- Oh, my God. That's wild.
- But it was, like, a million years ago.

396
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:53,745
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

397
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:56,112
- Why?
- Because the night you kissed Rachel...

398
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:59,346
...was the night I kissed Rachel
for the very first time.

399
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:03,015
- You kissed her that night too?
- Two guys in one night?

400
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:06,924
Oh, I thought she became a slut
after she got her nose fixed.

401
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:10,224
- Seriously, where did this happen?
- Okay...

402
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,960
...after you told me she was
passed out in our room...

403
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:15,536
...l went in there to make sure
she was all right.

404
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:19,403
She was lying on my bed,
all buried in people's coats.

405
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,441
I went to kiss her on the forehead...

406
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:24,046
...but it was so dark,
I accidentally got her lips.

407
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:27,809
I started to pull away, but then
I felt her start to kiss me back.

408
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:31,146
It was only for a second,
but it was amazing.

409
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:34,779
And now I find out
that you kissed her first.

410
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:38,155
- Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
- Mine.

411
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:41,627
- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
- No, she was definitely on my bed.

412
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:44,733
Why would I kiss a girl
and then put her on your bed?

413
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:47,059
Well, then who was on my bed?

414
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,838
No! No!

415
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,410
Yes!

416
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,982
- You were under the pile of coats?
- I was the pile of coats!

417
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,551
Oh, my God!

418
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:09,548
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!

419
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,357
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!

420
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:17,092
You were my first kiss ever?!

421
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:22,097
What did I marry into?!

422
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:58,203
Crap!
