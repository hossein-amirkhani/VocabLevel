1
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:04,978
You know, I'm thinking about letting
Emma have her first cookie.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,675
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

3
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:10,644
I've never given her a cookie.

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,488
- Have you?
- No.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,657
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

6
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,396
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

7
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:25,799
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

8
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:29,065
- Of course. I would be honored.
- Thank you.

9
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,574
I think there's been an oversight.

10
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:39,012
We would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

11
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:43,814
It's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

12
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,453
Clearly, we were wrong.

13
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:53,694
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

14
00:00:53,865 --> 00:00:56,265
I know how much you want
to have a baby...

15
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,494
...and I would love to help you get one.

16
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,532
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,200
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

18
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,806
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People...."

19
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:14,848
So excited about your letter.

20
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,887
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

21
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:23,016
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

22
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,495
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

23
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:28,257
What's it the anniversary of?

24
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:32,267
Your first date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

25
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:33,665
Yeah.

26
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,574
So you must be going
somewhere fancy to celebrate.

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,105
A Knicks game.

28
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,110
Aren't you a little overdressed?

29
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,476
I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

30
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:48,552
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,688
...I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

32
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:53,654
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

33
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,589
You guys do that?

34
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:58,662
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

35
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,695
That's where people
make number two.

36
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:04,158
So, you know, I have
a little time if you want to....

37
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:10,294
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

38
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,130
Fine. It's fine.

39
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:14,204
I'll just shower by myself.

40
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:18,967
B. B. B. B. B.

41
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,638
You gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

42
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:25,544
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

43
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:30,782
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open up! It's your sister!

44
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:33,288
I have to talk to you.

45
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,090
Hi, Amy.

46
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:43,196
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

47
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,061
Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,435
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

49
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:51,803
And you are?

50
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,878
Ross? I grew up on your block?

51
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,288
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

52
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,390
I had a baby with your sister?

53
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,289
No. I....

54
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:13,089
Did I buy a falafel
from you yesterday?

55
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:18,765
Yes. Yes, you did.

56
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,767
Hi, Rachel.
Here's your sister Amy.

57
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:28,378
She thinks I need pec implants.

58
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,678
Amy? Hi.

59
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:34,147
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

60
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,753
- The <i>Days of our Lives</i> guy.
- That's right, yeah.

61
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:39,313
You are not good.

62
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,984
Always nice to meet a fan.

63
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:48,730
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- Well, I have huge news.

64
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,360
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

65
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,563
Her name is Emma.

66
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:59,743
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

67
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,010
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

68
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:07,447
Hey, your English is getting better.

69
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,086
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

70
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:16,659
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

71
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:20,756
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

72
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:24,231
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

73
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:28,304
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

74
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,174
Watch.

75
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:36,645
Here, highlight the word you want
to change, go under "tools" ...

76
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:40,046
...and the thesaurus generates--
Gives.

77
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,587
Gives a whole list of choices.

78
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:46,280
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

79
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,926
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

80
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,391
No, no, I'm:

81
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:54,020
"Brainy, bright, clever."
I love this thing!

82
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,726
Look out, ladies! Joey Tribbiani's
got the whole package!

83
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:01,628
God...

84
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,366
...so beautiful.

85
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,066
I know, isn't she?

86
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:08,906
No, I was talking about your bedding.

87
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,976
All right, what's your news, Amy?

88
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:16,610
Well...

89
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,483
...I'm getting married.

90
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:20,955
Wow! Oh, my God!

91
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,686
- To who?
- This guy.

92
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,227
He has a killer apartment.

93
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:33,804
- And...?
- And it's on Fifth.

94
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,998
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

95
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,303
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

96
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:44,343
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

97
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:47,781
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

98
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,719
- Wow, so he's gotta be--
- Old? Yeah.

99
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,492
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

100
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,627
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

101
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:05,099
...you like the apartment
more than you like--

102
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,567
Myron.

103
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,566
Yeah, I told you he was old.

104
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,332
Sit down. Sit down.

105
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,101
Honey, you know...

106
00:07:13,278 --> 00:07:16,406
...l once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

107
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:18,811
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

108
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,517
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

109
00:07:24,522 --> 00:07:27,218
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

110
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:29,993
But anyway, listen.

111
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:34,029
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

112
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,329
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

113
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:43,463
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

114
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:46,371
...and that you care about.

115
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:49,411
You're right.

116
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,742
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

117
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,545
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

118
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,182
Okay, let's keep talking.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,901
Excuse me. Anniversary.

120
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:15,229
Excuse me. Anniversary.

121
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:22,346
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

122
00:08:24,182 --> 00:08:26,514
It's my anniversary.

123
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,416
Here we are.

124
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,923
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

125
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:37,789
This has been the best year....

126
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:42,659
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

127
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:45,428
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

128
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:47,628
I feel the same way!

129
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:52,266
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

130
00:08:55,814 --> 00:08:57,679
It's our anniversary.

131
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:03,720
<i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i>
<i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i>

132
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,753
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>

133
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:15,892
How lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

134
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,594
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

135
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,235
Excuse me.

136
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:30,246
I finished my recommendation. Here.

137
00:09:30,815 --> 00:09:33,784
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

138
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:37,388
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

139
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,982
I don't understand.

140
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,089
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

141
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,789
It doesn't make any sense.

142
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:53,267
Well, of course it does.
It's smart. I used a thesaurus.

143
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,902
On every word?

144
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,336
Yep.

145
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:03,507
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

146
00:10:03,948 --> 00:10:06,815
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

147
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:12,013
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing <i>Homo sapiens...</i>

148
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,489
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

149
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:20,529
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

150
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,834
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

151
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:27,301
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

152
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:30,339
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

153
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,513
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself.

154
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:41,413
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

155
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:43,486
Your full-sized aortic pump.

156
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:51,094
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

157
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:54,356
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

158
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,626
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

159
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,101
Yes, you are.

160
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:05,333
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

161
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,068
So can I stay with you?

162
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,975
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

163
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,686
Look who's back.

164
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:22,291
Why do you have bags?
Why does she have bags?

165
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,285
I'm staying with you guys.

166
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:26,589
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

167
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:27,822
Come on.

168
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,968
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:41,009
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

170
00:11:42,113 --> 00:11:46,174
But we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

171
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,717
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

172
00:11:48,886 --> 00:11:51,446
Last night I was finishing off
a pizza, and she said:

173
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,148
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

174
00:11:55,727 --> 00:11:58,628
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

175
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,991
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

176
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,497
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

177
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,999
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

178
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,672
No, it's just-- Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

179
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:18,282
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

180
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,417
Yeah. Monica made us.

181
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,219
Well, whatever.
I really appreciate it...

182
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,256
...because I don't think I would be
the person I am today...

183
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:29,256
...if it wasn't for you guys.

184
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,861
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

185
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,295
And I know it's gonna
take patience, but that's okay.

186
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:39,031
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

187
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:43,701
That's what I'm wearing today.
That's why I hung it on the door.

188
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:46,470
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

189
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,811
You know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

190
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:58,786
...for us to sit down and,
you know, talk about your future.

191
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,857
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

192
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,425
I am not happy.

193
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:08,863
Sure you want to eat that?

194
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:13,768
I'm curvy and I like it!

195
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,504
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,407
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

197
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,707
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

198
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:30,218
Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

199
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,948
- Seriously?
- Word.

200
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:38,523
Mine was worse than that.

201
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,857
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game.

202
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,830
This guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

203
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,765
- That is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

204
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:51,568
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

205
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,734
Oh, my God.
Mike was gonna propose?

206
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:56,072
- That's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

207
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,408
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

208
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,983
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna do it...

209
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:05,612
...l don't think he'll ever ask again.
I said no in Barbados, and now this?

210
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,623
She's right. If I were a guy and....

211
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:16,466
Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?

212
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:20,637
You don't need him to propose to you.
Maybe you could propose to him.

213
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:24,530
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

214
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:26,870
I proposed to Chandler.

215
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:32,616
All right, moving on.

216
00:14:33,017 --> 00:14:35,451
I don't think it was desperate.
It was amazing.

217
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,644
Thank you.

218
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:40,917
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

219
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:45,222
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

220
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,360
Okay. Okay.
So how should I do it?

221
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:52,799
How about at a game
on the big screen?

222
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:56,506
How about at a Foot Locker?

223
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:01,774
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

224
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,404
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

225
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,246
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

226
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,684
But what would a guy think?

227
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,727
- Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

228
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:20,552
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

229
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,759
She did?

230
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,164
Who got her condo in Boca?

231
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:27,770
Hello?

232
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,733
It's our nanny.

233
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,273
Hi.

234
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:37,403
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

235
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,174
That's Molly. She's sick.

236
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,513
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

237
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:45,588
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

238
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:47,587
Menstrual cramps.

239
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,860
I don't think that's what this is.

240
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:55,828
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,901
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

242
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,595
Great. Shoot.
What am I gonna do?

243
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,603
Well, I could do it.

244
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:07,232
- Well, actually....
- Can I talk to you for a second?

245
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,847
I do not want her babysitting our child.

246
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:15,611
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

247
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:19,119
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

248
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,383
- The next one?
- Okay.

249
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:25,361
I don't want her watching our baby.

250
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,966
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

251
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,964
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

252
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:35,231
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

253
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:36,668
You know, I don't know.

254
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,001
Ross, I'm telling you...

255
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:42,168
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

256
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,873
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

257
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:52,220
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

258
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,817
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

259
00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:00,122
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

260
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,329
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

261
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:07,733
So how much does it pay?

262
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,342
How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

263
00:17:16,514 --> 00:17:19,847
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

264
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:23,544
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

265
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,155
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

266
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:28,087
No can do, <i>amigo.</i>

267
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,821
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

268
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:36,560
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

269
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,134
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

270
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:41,535
See you later.

271
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:45,574
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

272
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:47,438
We're never gonna get a kid.

273
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:49,580
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

274
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:53,342
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

275
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:55,280
It's okay. You know what?

276
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:59,184
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

277
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,551
Okay, good.

278
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,926
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

279
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:07,292
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and....

280
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,628
Okay.

281
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:17,568
Thank you. Goodbye.

282
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,710
We're screwed, aren't we?

283
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,471
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

284
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,671
- They loved it.
- What?

285
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,718
They thought it was very smart of us
to have a child write the letter.

286
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,855
They thought Joey was a child?

287
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:36,050
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

288
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,823
- Hi.
- Hey, what'd you guys do today?

289
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:47,062
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

290
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:50,597
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

291
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:52,333
Babies are dull.

292
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:57,981
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

293
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,647
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

294
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,882
- Ready?
- Yeah.

295
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,851
You pierced her ears?

296
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:14,862
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

297
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:20,627
You pierced her ears?

298
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:23,137
How could you do this
without telling me?

299
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:27,004
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

300
00:19:27,344 --> 00:19:28,936
I think she looks cute.

301
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,874
But I am wrong.

302
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:37,120
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

303
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,855
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

304
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:43,021
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

305
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:47,062
Hi, Emma. Why is she wearing
her hat so low?

306
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:51,099
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

307
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,094
Why not?

308
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,932
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

309
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,508
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

310
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:02,737
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

311
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,540
Come here. Come here.

312
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:09,117
There she is. Hi.

313
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:13,785
- What?
- Nothing.

314
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,554
Hi.

315
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:19,657
What--?

316
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:34,642
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

317
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,477
Did she do this to her?

318
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:40,116
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

319
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:42,149
I know, I know.
And you were right, Ross.

320
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,914
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

321
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,217
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

322
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:52,123
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

323
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,025
Okay.

324
00:20:54,465 --> 00:21:00,097
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

325
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:05,364
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

326
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:06,942
This is how you repay me?

327
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:10,740
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

328
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:14,646
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

329
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,820
I am going to be a baby stylist.

330
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:24,123
- What?
- That's not a thing!

331
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,720
Well, it should be.

332
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:29,832
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

333
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,265
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

334
00:21:33,437 --> 00:21:37,567
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

335
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:41,908
- Amy, l-- I just-- I just wanna--
- What? What are you gonna do?

336
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,540
No more falafel for you!

337
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:00,755
Great game, huh?

338
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,732
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

339
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:10,100
Please let the Knicks win.

340
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,469
Thank you, Thor.

341
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,240
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

342
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,540
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

343
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:24,313
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

344
00:22:24,755 --> 00:22:28,486
<i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i>
<i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i>

345
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:32,758
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>

346
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:38,100
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

347
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:43,371
<i>Get a load of this.</i>
<i>She's proposing to him!</i>

348
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,101
<i>Guess we know who wears</i>
<i>the pants in that family.</i>

349
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,906
Well, that's not very enlightened.

350
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:57,078
Boo us? Boo you!

351
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:01,088
Odin will smite you!

352
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:11,533
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

353
00:23:11,702 --> 00:23:13,533
Oh, hi.

354
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,707
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

355
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:22,738
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

356
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:26,539
Okay, bye-bye.

357
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,244
She was nice.

358
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:35,886
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

359
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:41,159
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

360
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:43,527
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

361
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,696
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

362
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:51,432
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

363
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:54,600
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

364
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,302
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

365
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,948
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

366
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:03,917
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

367
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,181
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

368
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:10,259
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

369
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:14,362
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

370
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,557
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

371
00:24:17,735 --> 00:24:19,930
Except without that stupid Jill.

372
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,268
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

373
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:26,473
Seriously?

374
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,207
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

375
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,213
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

376
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:36,415
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

377
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:38,578
She was. Carbs found her.

378
00:24:42,993 --> 00:24:45,791
See? This is what I wanted.

379
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:49,364
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

380
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:53,994
Oh, I can give you that.

381
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:56,530
- You can?
- Yeah.

382
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,699
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're....

383
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:03,142
You're already a pretty perfect
version of what you are.

384
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:06,116
Thank you.

385
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:08,945
You gotta admit,
Emma does look cute.

386
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:14,046
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

387
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:21,388
Sis, you wanna go bring Jill some pasta?

388
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:26,069
Come on, Amy. Now, that's just wrong.

389
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:28,670
Her true weakness was garlic bread.

390
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,580
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

391
00:25:37,748 --> 00:25:40,046
Obviously, you have balls.

392
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:44,249
- Please, let's forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

393
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,321
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

394
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:48,818
But just so you know....

395
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:54,589
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

396
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:57,329
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

397
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:59,366
...or in skywriting...

398
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:02,300
...or, you know, like some
lame guy in a cheesy movie...

399
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,464
...who hides it in the cake.

400
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:12,677
It's in the cake, isn't it?

401
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,242
Where else would lame
Mr. No Balls hide it?

402
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:20,356
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

403
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:22,856
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

404
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:25,654
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

405
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:29,925
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you....

406
00:26:33,937 --> 00:26:37,600
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

407
00:26:41,111 --> 00:26:43,204
- Phoebe, l--
- Wait. Oh, wait.

408
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,408
Oh, no.

409
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:53,488
Okay.

410
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,150
Ready? Okay.

411
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:02,493
Phoebe, I love you.

412
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:08,663
There's no one else in the world
I would ask to marry me three times.

413
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,441
But I want to take care of you...

414
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,042
...have babies with you...

415
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,606
...and grow old with you.

416
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:22,777
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

417
00:27:23,787 --> 00:27:25,516
Yes.

418
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,554
- I love you.
- I love you more.

419
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:35,925
Not possible.

420
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:48,036
She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!

421
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:56,577
So how's the baby-styling
business going?

422
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:59,017
Not that great.

423
00:27:59,189 --> 00:28:02,852
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

424
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:06,521
That's shocking.

425
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:10,700
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

426
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:14,830
Hello, Ross?

427
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:17,897
He's rude.
