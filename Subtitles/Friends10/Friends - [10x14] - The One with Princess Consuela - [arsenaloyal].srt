1
00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:04,745
Thank you guys for having us over.

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:08,444
- Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
- I don't know why we don't hang out...

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,748
- ...with married couples more often.
- Because every time we do...

4
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:15,087
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,095
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.

6
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,795
Hey, you guys, I have great news.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,033
- We're kind of in the middle of dinner.
- Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.

8
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,569
Guess what happened at work today.

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,339
A dinosaur died a million years ago?

10
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:40,508
Try 65 million years ago. And then try:

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,080
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.

12
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:50,552
Yeah, do you have any idea what this
means in academic circles?

13
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,993
I am gonna get laid.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,261
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

15
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,698
Oh, ltalian.

16
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:01,435
No one--
No one wanted seconds, right?

17
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:02,972
No, I'm good.

18
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:06,701
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.

19
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:10,814
I have a meeting tomorrow
with Gucci. Gucci wants me.

20
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:13,281
- I'm up for tenure.
- Congratulations.

21
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,977
You too. What are the odds?

22
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:17,712
Guess what?

23
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:21,859
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.

24
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:25,289
I don't know who I'm happiest for.

25
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:28,160
I do. He's been working on that all day.

26
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:23,219
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?

27
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:27,119
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.

28
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:29,954
- Where'd you go to do it?
- The--

29
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:32,961
The Ministry of Names...

30
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:35,861
...Bureau.

31
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:37,999
You never did it.

32
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,638
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of--

33
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:43,366
Of being an official Bing.

34
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,640
Hey, I will have you know that--

35
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:51,806
Who am I kidding? Let's call the kid
Geller and let Bing die with me.

36
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,743
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,081
Honey, would you want me
to take your name?

38
00:02:57,255 --> 00:03:00,418
Oh, it's up to you. It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.

39
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:03,857
- Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
- Mrs. Hannigan?

40
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,361
Can't you see I'm
in the middle of something?

41
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,623
I like it.

42
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:12,363
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Joe.

43
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:15,631
We got things to check out
at the new house. You want to come?

44
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,605
- No, thank you.
- You're not happy about us moving...

45
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,177
...but you're the only one
who hasn't seen the house.

46
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,541
Yeah, come with us.
You'll see how close it is.

47
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:26,650
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.

48
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,911
I couldn't even find that on the map.

49
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:35,822
No, Joey. Escrow is....

50
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,222
There's money, and....

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,398
It's not the bank exactly.

52
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,230
I don't know what it is.

53
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:50,636
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.

54
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,678
You know what? You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.

55
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,212
I will come with you. Shotgun.

56
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:58,940
Damn it.

57
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,142
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.

58
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,287
- So glad you're coming.
- All right.

59
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,250
- Good for you. That was really mature.
- What? The only reason I'm going...

60
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,554
...to their stupid house is to point out
everything wrong with it...

61
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,130
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.

62
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,961
You're a strange kind of grownup.

63
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:21,965
Joey, you can't make someone do
something they don't want to do.

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,543
Believe me. There's something I've been
trying to get Mike to do in bed, and--

65
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:31,078
- Can we not talk about that now?
- All right. Prude.

66
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,177
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.

67
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,447
You are not gonna talk them
into staying here.

68
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,217
Hey, I can convince people
to do anything, you know?

69
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:44,624
I bet I could even get Mike
to do that thing. What is it?

70
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:50,633
I am not gonna help you do that!

71
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:52,633
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:03,104
Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Campbell,
with Gucci.

73
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:06,216
The reservation's probably under Gucci.

74
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,444
It's spelled like "gucky,"
which can be confusing.

75
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:14,221
Mr. Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.

76
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:21,059
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.

77
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,565
I'm sorry, that's always
Mr. Campbell's table.

78
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:27,637
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.

79
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:29,933
I know. With "gucky."

80
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,408
- Rachel?
- I'm on a date.

81
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:38,945
That's great.

82
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:42,746
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know,
it's tough. Single mom. Career.

83
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,481
You gotta get out there.

84
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:49,286
Well, you've got a good energy.

85
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,758
- Rachel?
- Yes, hi.

86
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,396
- James Campbell.
- Hi.

87
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:55,055
- Excuse us.
- Please.

88
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,263
He's cute.

89
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:05,207
Thank you, JewHunks.com, huh?

90
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,076
So...

91
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:10,612
...your résumé is quite impressive.

92
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:14,942
My résumé?

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,422
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a résumé.

94
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,959
Dating profile? No, I'm--
I'm talking about the work résumé.

95
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:31,324
Whatever happened
to just singing for no reason?

96
00:06:32,637 --> 00:06:35,333
Maybe people found it weird.

97
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:38,937
So....

98
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:42,671
- Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
- What?

99
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,371
- I don't.
- You don't?

100
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,312
No, I love-- I love it there.

101
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:49,681
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?

102
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,053
What?

103
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:57,425
That's Hugo Boss?

104
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:06,867
I believe what she's trying to tell you
is that I'm her boss.

105
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,335
Mr. Boss...

106
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:11,801
...it is a pleasure to meet you.

107
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:26,522
This place is so depressing.
If I had to work here, I'd kill myself.

108
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:32,055
But you obviously haven't.

109
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,464
- How can I help you?
- I need to change my name, please.

110
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:40,161
See, I need to change it
because I'm hiding from the law.

111
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,208
You're fun.

112
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,676
- You need to fill out this form.
- Okay. Well, just so I know--

113
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,144
I don't know how it works.
My name is Buffay...

114
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,044
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

115
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:55,152
So is it supposed to be
"Buffay-Hannigan" or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

116
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,982
- It can be anything you want.
- Well, not anything.

117
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,624
Yeah. Anything.

118
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,488
Oh, this could take a while.

119
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:08,365
- Get out of my line.
- Okay.

120
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,329
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

121
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:17,031
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.

122
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,735
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
- Wrong again.

123
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,807
Apparently, you can change it
to anything.

124
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:28,043
So I thought, "All right, here's
an opportunity to be creative."

125
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,882
So meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

126
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:40,660
That's what we were
gonna name the baby.

127
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:46,768
- Phoebe.
- Princess Consuela.

128
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,634
You seriously changed
your name to that?

129
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:53,039
Okay, so from now on, we have
to call you Princess Consuela?

130
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:56,374
No, I'm gonna have my friends
call me Valerie.

131
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:03,943
- Hey, how did the interview go?
- Not good.

132
00:09:04,122 --> 00:09:08,218
I always feel that way after an interview.
I'll bet it went better than you think.

133
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:13,160
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.

134
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:15,595
That is a bad interview.

135
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:18,292
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?

136
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,600
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...

137
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:24,105
...and he heard everything.

138
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:28,006
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...

139
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,806
...because I'm not a team player.

140
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,949
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

141
00:09:32,117 --> 00:09:34,779
And then I had to sit there
for 45 minutes...

142
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:39,322
...while he proved that that,
in fact, was true.

143
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:42,282
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

144
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,292
Hey.

145
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:48,626
What--? What's this?

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,634
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?

147
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,738
- Ross.
- I guess it's here...

148
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,339
...because I got tenure!

149
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:58,408
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

150
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:01,841
This is the single greatest day
of my professional career.

151
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,140
- Gunther. Six glasses.
- Six?

152
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:07,876
- You want me to join you?
- I thought Joey was here. Five is good.

153
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,524
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey
in my coffee tomorrow.

154
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:20,160
- Okay, I'll tell him.
- No. No, nobody tell him.

155
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:23,198
This is a big night for him.
I don't wanna spoil it.

156
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:24,960
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

157
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:28,663
Okay. Everybody take one, okay?

158
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,470
Israeli champagne.

159
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:33,907
And it's vanilla.

160
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,178
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.

161
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:40,449
Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?

162
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:43,644
Good. But I won't hear
about that for a couple days.

163
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,881
Oh, you know what,
you're gonna get it. I can feel it.

164
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:48,753
Can you?

165
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,191
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.

166
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:55,992
And to years of hard work
finally paying off.

167
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:00,001
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.

168
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:04,005
But also knowing it means a lot.

169
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:07,701
But more importantly, to full,
well-rounded lives.

170
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,642
That center around work.

171
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,805
- To Ross.
- To Ross.

172
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:19,352
You know what the best part
about this is? I can never be fired.

173
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:20,923
- Oh, God.
- No, seriously.

174
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:23,617
I have job security for life.

175
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,956
You know? I mean,
I never have to worry.

176
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:29,524
Oh, look at you.
Look how happy you are for me.

177
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:35,670
No, it's not that. I got fired today.

178
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,865
And I didn't get the other job.

179
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:44,140
Rach, I'm so sorry.

180
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:48,377
- Great, I feel like an idiot.
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

181
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:51,815
Little heads-up would've been nice.

182
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,723
Thank you for letting us
see the house again.

183
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,391
And thank you for explaining
to us what escrow means.

184
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,664
I've already forgotten
what you said, but thank you.

185
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,133
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.

186
00:12:14,846 --> 00:12:18,111
- So glad you decided to come.
- Me too. Yeah, this place is great.

187
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:22,310
So happy for you guys. Although,
you know, I hope you like fungus.

188
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,889
- What?
- Fungus.

189
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:27,615
Yeah. Place is full of it.

190
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,387
No, it's not. We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.

191
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:35,123
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.

192
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,326
Maybe it's because you hung
your head out the window like a dog...

193
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:40,596
...the whole ride here.

194
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,463
Maybe.

195
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:47,441
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.

196
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,708
- No, it's not.
- Are you kidding?

197
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:56,445
I think I just saw a bat in the corner.

198
00:12:57,255 --> 00:13:01,453
When your head was hanging out the
window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

199
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,085
Maybe.

200
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,693
Look, I just think you guys can
do better than this house, you know?

201
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,891
Or any other house for that matter.

202
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,434
Oh, Joey.

203
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:15,071
We know you're having a hard
time with this, but we--

204
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,901
- We love it here.
- Fine! If you love this house so much...

205
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:22,342
...you should live here. Okay? I hope you
get used to that weird humming sound.

206
00:13:24,048 --> 00:13:26,710
- Joey, we know that's you.
- No...

207
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,681
...it's not.

208
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,220
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

209
00:13:36,394 --> 00:13:38,225
- Oh, me too.
- So, what's new?

210
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,864
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.

211
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,523
- That's great. You changed your name?
- Yes, I did.

212
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:47,797
Meet Princess Consuela
Bananahammock.

213
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,465
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

214
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,837
- You really did that?
- Yep.

215
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:56,206
You can't do that.

216
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,575
Why?

217
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:01,014
Why? It's fun. It's different.
No one else has a name like it.

218
00:14:02,787 --> 00:14:04,277
Then I'm gonna change my name.

219
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:06,685
Great. Okay, what are
you gonna change it to?

220
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:08,757
Crap Bag.

221
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:14,295
- Mike Crap Bag?
- No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."

222
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:17,263
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.

223
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,335
- You're not serious, right?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

224
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,531
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.

225
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:27,604
Well, then great.
If you love it, I love it.

226
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,839
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.

227
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,279
And I love Crap.

228
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:45,562
- Who are you?
- Oh, hi. I'm Joey.

229
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,563
My stupid friends are buying
this house. Who are you?

230
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,601
I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents
are selling this house.

231
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,535
I hate my parents.

232
00:14:56,707 --> 00:14:59,039
I hate my friends.

233
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,212
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.

234
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,975
Like what?

235
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:12,953
Okay, you come with me and you
tell them that the house is haunted.

236
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,217
What are you, 8?

237
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:22,057
- Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
- I don't have any great ideas.

238
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,224
I am 8.

239
00:15:26,637 --> 00:15:28,605
There's gotta be a way.
I mean, you know...

240
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:32,038
...if Monica and Chandler move here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...

241
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,873
...that just leaves me and Ross
and Rach. You know what I mean?

242
00:15:36,547 --> 00:15:38,014
I really don't.

243
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,481
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.

244
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:46,111
- My parents say I'll make new friends.
- Yeah, sure, easy for you.

245
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,815
You're young.
Me? I'm set in my ways.

246
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:54,592
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.

247
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:01,027
Look, you want your friends
to be happy, right?

248
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,740
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

249
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:09,175
Well, if moving here is gonna make them
happy, don't you want them to do it?

250
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:12,307
Yeah. Maybe.

251
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,542
Then you've gotta let them go.

252
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:23,258
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're--

253
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,588
You're probably right.

254
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:27,992
How'd you get to be so smart?

255
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,359
I read a lot.

256
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,364
Just when I thought we could be friends.

257
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:41,378
Oh, hey, Rach.
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

258
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:43,343
Oh, thank you....

259
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:46,639
You still don't know my name, do you?

260
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:49,352
Well, now I don't have to.

261
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:56,756
Ross, what is taking you so long?

262
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:08,772
I'm sorry. It's almost as if this wasn't
built for a quick getaway.

263
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:13,076
Rachel?

264
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:16,377
Mark? Oh, my God.

265
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:20,210
- How have you been?
- Fantastic. You remember Ross.

266
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:22,579
Sure. Sure.

267
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,015
What's with the chair?

268
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:30,226
You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so....

269
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,292
Clever.

270
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,329
So how are you?

271
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,490
You're not catching me
on my best day.

272
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:40,762
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff
doesn't say "big promotion."

273
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:44,601
No, but it's good. You know,
I'm gonna take some time off...

274
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,675
- ...and do charity work.
- Are you sure?

275
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,675
We may have something
at Louis Vuitton.

276
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,337
Screw charity work. What do you got?

277
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:53,380
Why don't we have dinner and talk?

278
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,479
- Great. I'll call you.
- Okay.

279
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:59,214
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.

280
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,052
Oh, my God.

281
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,665
See? I told you something
good would come along.

282
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:12,769
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?

283
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,064
Ross, that's Mark.

284
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:18,970
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.

285
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,008
- That is Mark?
- Yes.

286
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,611
I hate that guy.

287
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,406
No, no, no. You cannot
go to dinner with him.

288
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:30,281
- What? You don't want me to get a job?
- Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.

289
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,388
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."

290
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:35,991
I'm serious. I just
don't trust that guy, okay?

291
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,153
You know what--? Okay, let's talk
about it later. There comes security.

292
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:52,969
Oh, I love this street.

293
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:57,808
The trees and the big front yards
and the actual picket fences.

294
00:18:57,982 --> 00:19:00,644
Man, those two dogs are going at it.

295
00:19:04,588 --> 00:19:07,853
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, just, you know, looking around.

296
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:09,549
But you know what?

297
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,854
This house is great.

298
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,826
Really? What changed your mind?

299
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:17,729
The little girl who lives here made me
feel better about the whole thing.

300
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:22,567
Joey? There was a little girl who lived
here, but she died, like, 30 years ago.

301
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:29,512
What?

302
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,647
I'm just messing with you.

303
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:37,280
That's not funny. You know
I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.

304
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:41,022
Now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?

305
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,085
What?

306
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,522
I get my own room?

307
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:48,657
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?

308
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,328
Oh, my God.

309
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:57,706
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?

310
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:03,140
- No.
- Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.

311
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,083
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.

312
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:09,719
Thank you, Mr. Bag.

313
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,716
- Oh, hi, Rita.
- How are you?

314
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,121
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.

315
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,692
Yeah.

316
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:19,762
Why don't you introduce me?

317
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,459
Rita, this is my husband.

318
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:27,401
Why don't you tell her my name?

319
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:33,109
Okay, I will. This is--
This is my husband, Crap Bag.

320
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,171
Crap Bag?

321
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:40,511
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.

322
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:46,682
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

323
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:52,885
Okay, fine, you made your point. Can
you please just be Mike Hannigan again?

324
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,621
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.

325
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:59,202
How about--?
How about Buffay-Hannigan?

326
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,359
Really?

327
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:04,304
Yeah. I'm Phoebe
Buffay-Hannigan-Bananahammock.

328
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:08,569
Do you even know what
a banana hammock is?

329
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,573
It's a funny word.

330
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,443
It's a Speedo.

331
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:18,254
Oh, crap.

332
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,089
- What are you thinking about?
- Oh, you know.

333
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:28,731
The two dogs.

334
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,697
- Hey, is Rachel here?
- Nope.

335
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:37,568
She's still at dinner?

336
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,301
- I guess. Why, who's she with?
- That guy, Mark...

337
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:43,537
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.

338
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:45,739
But I know he really wants
to sleep with her.

339
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,180
It's seven years ago.

340
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,250
My time machine works.

341
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:57,420
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.

342
00:21:57,595 --> 00:22:00,223
But I know he just wants
to get into her pants.

343
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:05,296
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.

344
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:06,868
Excuse me?

345
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:08,800
Oh, please.

346
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:11,441
Yesterday, on the subway,
you couldn't stop staring...

347
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:13,474
...at that woman with the big breasts.

348
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,511
For your information,
I was staring at her baby.

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,511
We're about to be parents.

350
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,318
Oh, sorry.

351
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:34,454
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi. So...

352
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:38,193
- ...how was dinner?
- Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.

353
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:42,032
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why? What
could that smarmy letch possibly want?

354
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:47,473
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily
married. His wife just had twins.

355
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:49,769
Should we send something?

356
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:52,909
How did the job stuff go?

357
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:55,448
He offered me one.

358
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,880
- That's great.
- Congratulations.

359
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:00,887
I know, it's amazing.

360
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:05,085
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.

361
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:07,594
- The money is great.
- Can we--?

362
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:12,225
Can we just stop for a second? Who said
something better would come along?

363
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:15,895
You didn't believe me. I told you
everything was gonna work out.

364
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:19,133
You know what? This calls
for a bottle of lsrael's finest.

365
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,814
The job is in Paris.

366
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:41,130
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...

367
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,129
...but am I missing opportunities?

368
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,167
You know, I've always thought
of myself as a serious actor.

369
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,862
Should I be trying to do
more independent movies?

370
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,332
I don't know.

371
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:55,336
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.

372
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:57,207
Hold on.

373
00:23:58,349 --> 00:23:59,941
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.
