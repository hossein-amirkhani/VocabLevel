1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:03,770
Hi!

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:05,416
- Hey!
- Hi!

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,853
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!

4
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,449
Champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.

5
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,525
It was so romantic.

6
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:17,559
- Where's Mike?
- He's at the doctor.

7
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,526
He didn't poop while we were there.

8
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:27,062
Shoot, I wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,003
I mean-- Okay, he's at a gig.

10
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,939
A gig we are definitely not going to.

11
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,237
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?

12
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:39,646
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...

13
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:43,049
...which, according to my résumé,
I'm fluent in.

14
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:47,555
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.

15
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:50,593
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?

16
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:53,991
It was okay.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,063
I did not know you spoke French.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,364
You're so sexy.

19
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,872
- Well, so will you help me?
- Sure.

20
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,249
Seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.

21
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:04,961
- Hey.
- Hi.

22
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,934
Why are you wearing my apron?

23
00:02:08,206 --> 00:02:09,571
I'm making cookies for Erica.

24
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:12,835
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.

25
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,344
When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...

26
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,109
...and the woman who's
carrying my child?

27
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,213
No?

28
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,684
Divorce?

29
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:27,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:30,023
- You know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.

31
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:33,756
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.

32
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,524
- Hey!
- Hey!

33
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:39,137
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?

34
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,705
Well, I want the baby
to come out all cute and fat!

35
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:47,972
- So why is Erica coming to visit?
- We wanna get to know her better.

36
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:51,274
She's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:

37
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,350
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

38
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:57,454
There's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

39
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:01,922
And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

40
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:05,229
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?

41
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:08,928
- You should take her to a museum.
- Oh, please.

42
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,228
So I can hear Chandler say
over and over again:

43
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:14,065
"You call this art? I could make that."

44
00:03:14,773 --> 00:03:17,367
It was a tower of sponges.

45
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:23,503
Oh, hi. Hi. Thanks for
showing up 30 minutes late.

46
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:27,413
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?

47
00:03:27,586 --> 00:03:30,919
A mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?

48
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,158
My father had a heart attack.

49
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:36,658
While I was at Barneys.

50
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:40,960
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?

51
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,533
- I'm so sorry.
- Is he okay?

52
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:46,170
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.

53
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:48,499
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long lsland with you.

54
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:53,269
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.

55
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,879
I don't need you to come.

56
00:03:56,047 --> 00:04:02,008
- I can totally handle this on my own.
- Still, still, let me come for me.

57
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,213
Okay. If you really need to.

58
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,484
I bet someone could use one
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,924
Oh, I really could.

60
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,999
All right, it seems pretty simple.

61
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,367
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."

62
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,634
So just repeat after me.

63
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:35,553
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.

64
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:44,028
It's not...

65
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,130
...quite what I'm saying.

66
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:50,163
Really? Sounds exactly the same to me.

67
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,826
- It does, really?
- Yeah.

68
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,437
- Let's just try it again.
- Okay.

69
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,131
- Really listen.
- Got it.

70
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,053
- Hey, you guys!
- Hi.

71
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,885
I want you to meet
someone really special.

72
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:17,620
Phoebe, this is Erica.
And this is the baby!

73
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:20,492
- Joey, Erica, baby.
- Hi.

74
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:23,190
Everyone, Erica! Baby!

75
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,963
Monica. Calm. Self.

76
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,405
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.

77
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:31,337
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

78
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,171
Well, welcome to New York City,
or should I say:

79
00:05:34,746 --> 00:05:36,714
New York City.

80
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:39,808
Why would you say that?

81
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:43,281
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?

82
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:48,415
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney lsland, Rockefeller Center.

83
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:51,687
You should walk to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

84
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,730
- Oh, yeah, let's do that.
- Great.

85
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,765
This baby better be really good.

86
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:06,072
Hi. Excuse me, I'm here to see my
father. My name is Rachel Green.

87
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:09,304
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.

88
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,608
That actually means something here.

89
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,218
- So can we please go in?
- Absolutely.

90
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,354
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...

91
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:20,423
...because my throat is feeling a little
scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

92
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:25,222
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.

93
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:28,560
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
- I'm feeling better.

94
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,161
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:41,137
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

96
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,846
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

97
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,678
Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?

98
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:51,185
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.

99
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,061
- Did the TV wake you?
- No.

100
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,825
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.

101
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,198
What are you doing here, Geller?

102
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,641
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.

103
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,482
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.

104
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:54,713
Right. Is it painful?

105
00:07:54,886 --> 00:07:58,014
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

106
00:07:59,157 --> 00:08:02,217
Let's see if we can get
that Rachel back in here.

107
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:06,353
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?

108
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,159
Nope. Just the one. Rach!

109
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,133
Daddy, hi. You're awake.

110
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:15,534
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

111
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:19,837
By the way, Ross has been
of great comfort.

112
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,712
They want to keep you here
for a couple more nights.

113
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:24,906
I know.

114
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,551
But I'm gonna go home
and get a bunch of your stuff...

115
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,448
...so that you're really comfortable.

116
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,248
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

117
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:32,754
It's pretty ironic, huh?

118
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:36,257
You being a heart surgeon,
and you had a heart attack.

119
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:40,990
It'd be like if I was eaten
by an <i>Allosaurus</i>.

120
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,931
I'm gonna wait outside.

121
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,368
"He's pretty much out."

122
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,409
No!

123
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:01,616
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.

124
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:06,951
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.

125
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:12,490
Great! Okay, faster.

126
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:23,373
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?

127
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,305
I have to go before I put
your head through a wall.

128
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:30,312
Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!

129
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,997
Hey. I was gonna
make us some dinner...

130
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:53,103
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

131
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:56,138
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

132
00:09:56,741 --> 00:09:59,505
- Did you call your parents?
- Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.

133
00:09:59,677 --> 00:10:01,167
Oh, good.

134
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,016
- What?
- I just can't believe...

135
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:08,277
...I'm in Rachel Green's room.

136
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:14,148
- You've been in my room before.
- Yeah, sure, right.

137
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,687
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.

138
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:20,262
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

139
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,097
Sorry.

140
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:26,133
- You okay?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,135
- Yeah, you had a rough day.
- Yeah.

142
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:32,572
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

143
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:35,679
You don't expect doctors to get sick.

144
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,815
But we do.

145
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,816
He's gonna be okay, Rach.

146
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:51,328
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.

147
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,464
- What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
- What?

148
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:55,292
They gave him a lot of medication.

149
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,297
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

150
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:59,766
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

151
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,304
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No-- God, hey.

152
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,703
Rach, you've been an
amazing daughter, okay?

153
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:08,937
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

154
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:10,876
Good night.

155
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,609
Wait, wait, wait.

156
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:18,247
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?

157
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,724
- Sure.
- Okay.

158
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:26,360
- Thank you for coming with me today.
- Oh, of course.

159
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:29,796
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.

160
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,460
Me too. Come here.

161
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,931
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

162
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:43,246
Okay, well, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or--

163
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,560
No, Rach!

164
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:05,001
I'm sorry, I just don't
think this is a good idea.

165
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:08,195
Well, we won't know that
until we do it, will we?

166
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,098
Look--

167
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:14,969
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...

168
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,171
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.

169
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:20,044
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.

170
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:24,416
What--? Taking advantage? I am giving
you the advantage. Enjoy!

171
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:27,887
Look, I'm sure it would be great...

172
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,358
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.

173
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,997
So I'm gonna go.

174
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,866
Okay.

175
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:46,300
I'll see you in the morning.

176
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:53,240
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!

177
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:02,690
Thanks so much for taking me
to all those places. I had a great time.

178
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,693
I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize
about Chandler, though.

179
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:10,562
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!

180
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,396
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...

181
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:17,268
...but I've never really seen them.

182
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,501
Yeah, you miss a lot
when you're mooing.

183
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:23,777
Let's go to a Broadway show. <i>Cats</i>!

184
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:25,910
I think we've done enough.

185
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:30,384
Honey, these are actors dressed like cats
who sing like people.

186
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,783
I mean, come on!

187
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:36,857
- Thank you for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

188
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,326
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.

189
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,727
Well, if there's anything else
you wanna know....

190
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:46,731
Okay.

191
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:49,802
Can we ask you some
questions about the father?

192
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,101
Oh, sure. Yeah.

193
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:56,770
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

194
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:00,882
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.

195
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:05,484
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

196
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:08,624
How's that, now?

197
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,891
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.

198
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:15,590
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...

199
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,167
...but they sort of overlapped.

200
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:20,461
So, what does the other guy do?

201
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:24,074
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.

202
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:29,971
Was he falsely accused of something?

203
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:32,148
No.

204
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,580
He killed his father with a shovel.

205
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:38,449
Other than that, he's a great guy.

206
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:41,725
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

207
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,560
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

208
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,704
Assume from now on
that I'm always awake.

209
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:58,906
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

210
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:02,739
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.

211
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,810
Well, all right,
let's say that it is him.

212
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,681
Would we not want the baby? No.

213
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:14,222
- Would we treat him any differently?
- I'd keep an eye on him.

214
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,886
We have to find out
who the father is.

215
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,860
- How?
- I don't know.

216
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:25,162
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.

217
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:28,703
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.

218
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,105
He probably loves his mommy.

219
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,836
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

220
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,912
<i>We'll now count from one to five.</i>

221
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:56,126
- <i>Good job.</i>
- Thank you.

222
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,229
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey.

223
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:03,339
Listen, I feel really badly about
yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.

224
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:06,841
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.

225
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,808
That's okay. I don't need your help.

226
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,881
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say I am pretty good.

227
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,584
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.

228
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,015
Okay.

229
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,626
See?

230
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,193
You, you're not--

231
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,035
You're not-- You're--

232
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:36,435
Again, you're not speaking French!

233
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:42,178
Oh, well, I think I am. Yeah, and I think
I'm definitely gonna get the part.

234
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:44,405
How could you possibly think that?

235
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,278
The guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

236
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:54,219
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?

237
00:16:56,294 --> 00:16:57,921
Sure.

238
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,727
You've been quiet all morning.
Is everything okay?

239
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,530
- You sure you're all right?
- Yep.

240
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,001
Okay.

241
00:17:10,174 --> 00:17:12,642
Well, I'm gonna go
grab us some breakfast.

242
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,643
- FYl.
- There it is.

243
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:17,974
In the future...

244
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:23,712
...when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

245
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:28,819
Wait, wait, you're mad at me
about last night?

246
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:31,826
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- Really?

247
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:33,793
If you had done the right thing...

248
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,763
...l wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.

249
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:40,370
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.

250
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,798
- Well--
- Oh, stop that!

251
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,545
I can't believe this.
I was just being a good guy.

252
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,375
I treated you with
respect and understanding.

253
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,039
Oh, that is so hot.

254
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,016
Hey, I was looking out for you.

255
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,553
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
I am a big girl.

256
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,351
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.

257
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:07,086
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot
of times before. This is the worst ever!

258
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:10,729
Oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

259
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:13,195
Okay, you know--?
Hey, hey, you know what?

260
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,339
To avoid this little thing
in the future...

261
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:18,134
...let's just say you and me?
Never having sex again.

262
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,937
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!

263
00:18:21,112 --> 00:18:24,878
I am never having sex with you again!

264
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:33,413
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

265
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:39,258
- Hey. How was lunch?
- We had a good time.

266
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,297
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

267
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:45,799
It would really mean a lot to me
if the baby was a boy...

268
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,961
...that you name him after my father...

269
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,266
...Jiminy Billy Bob.

270
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,905
- Oh, really?
- No!

271
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:00,448
You were right. That was fun.

272
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:04,281
I'm gonna go finish packing.

273
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:11,427
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.

274
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,995
- I found out who the father is.
- Oh, God.

275
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,225
- It's Shovely Joe, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

276
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,459
How do you know?

277
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:21,332
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed class...

278
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,837
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?

279
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,999
It'd be pretty hard to make
a baby that way.

280
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:30,773
Oh, God, what was it? The thing we
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?

281
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,509
The thing we never do.

282
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:38,087
Shovely Joe.

283
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:50,089
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right.

284
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:03,376
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.

285
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,450
Joey, do you speak French?

286
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,084
That's not French.

287
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:21,763
Neither is that.

288
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,563
You know what?
I think this audition is over.

289
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,203
Excuse me?

290
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,401
I am Régine Phalange.

291
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,579
I was passing by when
I heard this man speaking...

292
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,780
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estée Lauder.

293
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,216
You really think this man
is speaking French?

294
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:22,114
Good job, little buddy.

295
00:21:25,229 --> 00:21:26,992
That was some really good French.

296
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:29,860
But I think we're gonna go
with someone else for the part.

297
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:34,565
- All right, but my French was good?
- It was great.

298
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,069
See?

299
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,317
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

300
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:52,353
- So I guess I'm gonna take off.
- Okay.

301
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:55,151
Hey, listen, just before you go--

302
00:21:55,326 --> 00:21:57,590
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.

303
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,194
Oh, no problem.

304
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,465
And also, you know, l--

305
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:07,366
I was thinking about what you said,
you know, about the whole sex thing....

306
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:11,167
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.

307
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:14,470
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

308
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,773
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.

309
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:20,547
Yeah.

310
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:23,118
Yeah, that's true.

311
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:26,489
Hey, do you remember
that one really great time?

312
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:28,352
- Oh, yeah!
- You know?

313
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:31,790
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.

314
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:35,288
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:42,369
Well, I guess that's all
in the past now.

316
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,679
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

317
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:54,617
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...

318
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:57,913
- ...really bad.
- That's what we decided.

319
00:22:58,088 --> 00:22:59,715
Right.

320
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:05,290
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
- Yeah.

321
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:09,296
When two people have a connection,
you know, that's--

322
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,329
Just seems like...

323
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:13,993
...such a...

324
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,196
...waste.

325
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,808
I hate waste.

326
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,912
- Ross?
- Yes?

327
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:31,020
Just so you know...

328
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,916
...with us...

329
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:36,616
...it's never off the table.

330
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:50,371
Damn it, it's never off the table.

331
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:01,648
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.

332
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,787
It's off the résumé.

333
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:07,046
- Archery?
- No.

334
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:10,660
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

335
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:14,528
You can drink a gallon of milk
in 10 seconds?

336
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:16,495
That I can do.

337
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:20,296
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

338
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:22,371
All right, watch me.

339
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:29,109
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- Ready, go!

340
00:24:59,276 --> 00:25:00,368
You did it!
