1
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:13,216
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna...?

2
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:16,488
You know, I'd love to,
but I'm a little tired.

3
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:19,757
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

4
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,560
- Hey.
- What's up?

5
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:26,795
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

6
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:31,100
And then we're gonna grab some food.
So if you want--

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,335
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

8
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,844
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

9
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,749
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

10
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:43,410
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

11
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:46,080
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

12
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,188
Yeah, I hear someone else
in there with him.

13
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,767
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

14
00:00:56,935 --> 00:01:00,063
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,203
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

16
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:09,746
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,548
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,085
This is none of our business.

19
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:19,587
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

20
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:24,626
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

21
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:27,287
I love Barbados.

22
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:36,506
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm kissing Rachel!

23
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:40,635
I know. I'm her.

24
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,681
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,647
- What?
- Get over here!

26
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:55,483
Oh, my God! I love how thin
these walls are!

27
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,771
Thank you.

28
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:01,322
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

29
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:04,189
Well, I only said that because of Ross.

30
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:07,229
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

31
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:09,390
Ross and Charlie?

32
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:13,766
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

33
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,239
- Eh, who am I to talk?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:23,111
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

35
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:26,375
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

36
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:30,283
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

37
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,017
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

38
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:38,253
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

39
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:41,694
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

40
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,495
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

41
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,999
Wow! Wait a minute.

42
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,935
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

43
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,774
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

44
00:03:56,948 --> 00:04:00,816
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

45
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,018
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

46
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:07,181
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

47
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:13,563
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

48
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:25,932
- Is everything okay?
- It's just-- I don't think I can do this.

49
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,477
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

50
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:32,014
- I saw that report, with the infrared--
- No! No.

51
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,118
No.

52
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:38,955
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

53
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:42,992
Before anything more happens between
us, I need to know he's okay with it.

54
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:47,354
- I completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

55
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:54,169
I just need a second before I can,
you know....

56
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:02,306
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

57
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,144
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

58
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,683
That's the door. He's gone.

59
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,852
And she's turning on the TV...

60
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:22,830
...and watching <i>Miss Congeniality</i>.

61
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:27,495
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

62
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,744
Hey, what are you guys doing?

63
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,883
We're just-- We're sad to go, so we're
just saying goodbye to the hotel.

64
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,751
I love you...

65
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:52,387
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

66
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:56,732
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

67
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,867
Bye.

68
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:07,669
Okay. Hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

69
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,871
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

70
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,677
That's the situation as we know it.

71
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:19,016
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

72
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,420
- You got it.
- Thanks.

73
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,094
Thank you.

74
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,195
Other wall, people! Other wall!

75
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:40,738
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

76
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:43,039
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

77
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,375
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

78
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,178
All right? So just be nonchalant.

79
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,787
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

80
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,932
Okay, just hide.

81
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,830
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

82
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:10,265
There's no room under the bed--

83
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:16,007
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:26,151
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

85
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,726
I really don't.

86
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,960
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

87
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:39,768
I don't believe this.
Have you guys been--?

88
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,735
This is the listening side of the wall.

89
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:51,338
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

90
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:54,076
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

91
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,611
Right. Yeah.

92
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,846
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie
out since the day I met her.

93
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,582
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

94
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,787
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

95
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:08,159
...before you know it, we were kissing.

96
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,665
How angry do you think
Joey's gonna be?

97
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:14,665
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

98
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,970
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

99
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:19,666
You would think.

100
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,213
Joey?

101
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:29,876
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

102
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,151
What? Hey!

103
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:37,692
What are you--? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

104
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,761
Yeah!

105
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,956
Now, what is this?

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,335
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

107
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:49,906
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

108
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,533
No, no. Have you thought
about how complicated this could get?

109
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,975
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

110
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:59,708
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

111
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:03,718
And as his friend, I mean, don't you
think he deserves the same from you?

112
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,718
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

113
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,422
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

114
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,067
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

115
00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:20,602
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

116
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:22,705
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

117
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,168
Get out!

118
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,183
Are they right?

119
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:38,221
Probably, yeah. I mean,
maybe we should...

120
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,254
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

121
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:45,318
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

122
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,088
Yeah, I think that would be best.

123
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:51,034
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take off.

124
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,538
- Although--
- I like "although."

125
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,373
I mean, you know....

126
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:00,909
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

127
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,876
...six years.

128
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,912
Six years?

129
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:08,750
Wow. That's almost as long
as high school.

130
00:10:13,391 --> 00:10:16,588
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

131
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,284
Absolutely.

132
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:21,057
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

133
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,397
I'm thinking about you.

134
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,637
Yeah.

135
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:32,773
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

136
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,577
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

137
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:38,906
Seriously, what is it?

138
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:43,818
Nothing. It's really-- It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

139
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,952
What's wrong?

140
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,583
Sorry, I just....

141
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:53,754
I can't seem to get Ross
out of my head.

142
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,195
Well, maybe I can help.

143
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:07,205
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

144
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:13,048
Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.

145
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,153
Hey. You guys ready to go?

146
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:24,192
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

147
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,728
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

148
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,424
You're not supposed to take that.

149
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:33,537
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

150
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,605
Learn about Jesus.

151
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,738
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

152
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:45,315
No. I couldn't find him. I'm just
gonna talk to him on the plane.

153
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:49,247
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

154
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,878
Stop it.

155
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,585
Ph.D.

156
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,055
You're filthy.

157
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,425
- Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?
- Actually, I think she went to the salon.

158
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:04,932
Oh, yeah. Oh, she went
to the salon, all right.

159
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,628
Check it out!

160
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:11,367
Whose day just got better?

161
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,101
Chandler!

162
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,705
Hey!

163
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:21,443
- What do you think?
- I think....

164
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,349
I think I can see your scalp.

165
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,783
Don't you just love it?

166
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,893
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

167
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:34,565
It's something. You go, girlfriend.

168
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,294
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

169
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:39,663
I thought so.

170
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,833
- Phoebe?
- I'm so glad you did that.

171
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:45,699
Oh, and listen to this.

172
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:54,711
What do you know? It's a treat
for the eyes and the ears.

173
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:12,730
Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

174
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:16,737
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

175
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:20,066
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

176
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:24,237
Oh, I mean, l-- Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

177
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:25,905
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

178
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:31,149
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen lverson over there.

179
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,389
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:47,168
Once we're in the air and the
captain turns off the seat belt sign...

181
00:13:47,338 --> 00:13:50,398
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

182
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,941
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

183
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:59,515
- Because items may shift during--
- Oh, you're not good at this.

184
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,418
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

185
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,956
It's Saturday, right?

186
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,458
What?

187
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:14,359
- I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

188
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:16,597
I have a date.

189
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:23,605
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

190
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,537
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,578
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

192
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:33,342
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

193
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:35,178
Three months?

194
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:37,745
Okay.

195
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:42,825
This is none of my business, but how
long are you gonna keep seeing her?

196
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:46,194
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

197
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,922
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

198
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,367
When you get home, maybe there'll be a
special delivery package waiting for you.

199
00:14:55,106 --> 00:14:58,473
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

200
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:04,541
- Pull out the packing material--
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

201
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,884
It's our last glimpse of Barbados.

202
00:15:12,256 --> 00:15:15,350
And my last glimpse of anything.

203
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:23,756
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

204
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:27,165
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

205
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:31,269
Okay. Good luck.

206
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:35,776
You know, if he's not okay with this
then nothing more can happen between us.

207
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:37,209
I know.

208
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,872
Well, if that's the case,
I just want you to know...

209
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:43,714
...that I think I could have fallen for you
really, really hard.

210
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:48,549
On the other hand,
if he is okay with us...

211
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,960
...then, you know, it's cas, whatever.

212
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,532
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

213
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,931
I guess so. I'm just--
I'm really nervous.

214
00:16:02,106 --> 00:16:04,506
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

215
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:07,439
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

216
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,311
Still nervous?

217
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,544
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

218
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:16,851
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

219
00:16:17,054 --> 00:16:20,512
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

220
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,659
<i>Good luck.</i>

221
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,224
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,763
So l....

223
00:16:31,936 --> 00:16:34,496
I kind of need to talk to you
about Charlie.

224
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:38,665
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up....

225
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:42,210
So sorry to hear about that,
by the way.

226
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,015
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and....

227
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,751
Well....

228
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,620
You kissed.

229
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,250
Wh-- What?

230
00:16:57,428 --> 00:17:00,454
What? What would give you that idea?

231
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:03,259
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

232
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:08,662
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

233
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:11,933
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

234
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:14,668
It's okay. You know, look...

235
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,939
...l totally understand, all right?
You guys...

236
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:22,916
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And....

237
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:26,284
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

238
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,015
Yeah.

239
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:33,960
- Now I have something--
- I am speechless.

240
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:39,998
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean....

241
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,638
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

242
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,502
- Well, look, before you go--
- No, I mean it.

243
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:52,377
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

244
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,980
I am those things, yeah.

245
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,955
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

246
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,693
...l may have to rethink some stuff.

247
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,390
Dude!

248
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:11,898
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you....

249
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:15,933
I can't think of anything.

250
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:20,736
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

251
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,313
- So hi.
- Hi.

252
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:30,818
- So you talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

253
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:32,888
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

254
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,992
- So everything's okay?
- Oh, no, it's great.

255
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,655
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

256
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,964
Well, I'm so excited about this.

257
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:49,306
Really? Excited?

258
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:55,002
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

259
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:00,377
Excuse me.

260
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,588
You didn't tell him, did you?

261
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:12,024
I couldn't. He was saying all
these really nice things about me.

262
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:16,530
I didn't want him to get mad and take
them back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler!

263
00:19:17,301 --> 00:19:20,532
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

264
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,502
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

265
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,359
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

266
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:47,224
- That was fast.
- <i>Oh, no, she's not here yet.</i>

267
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,831
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

268
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:55,563
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

269
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:02,376
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

270
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:07,813
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYl.

271
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:13,549
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

272
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,123
Her name's Precious?

273
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:19,524
Is she a pure breed,
or did you pick her up at the pound?

274
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:24,733
- <i>I just want to give you a heads up.</i>
- Okay. And if she gets upset...

275
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:28,029
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

276
00:20:35,246 --> 00:20:37,771
What do you know,
another hot blonde.

277
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,050
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

278
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,724
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

279
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,954
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

280
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:03,935
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

281
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:07,940
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

282
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:10,113
So if you want people to see them...

283
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:13,273
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

284
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:17,512
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

285
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:26,491
You like that, right?

286
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:36,834
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from <i>10.</i>

287
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,942
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

288
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:44,913
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

289
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:48,677
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it....

290
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,718
I hate them.

291
00:21:51,522 --> 00:21:55,583
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did l? Let's refresh.

292
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,956
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

293
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:03,091
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

294
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:06,570
Again, let's journey back.

295
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:11,534
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

296
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:16,237
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

297
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:20,684
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

298
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:24,184
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

299
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,815
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

300
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:45,042
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

301
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:48,268
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

302
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,278
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Greene? Huh?

303
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:55,441
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

304
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,415
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

305
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:06,923
Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for
you, okay? I want you to wait right here.

306
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:08,826
Come here, sweetie.

307
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:14,267
Ross, actually, there's something
that I really need to talk to you about.

308
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,132
Okay, shoot.

309
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:21,939
- Okay. All right, here's the deal.
- Oh, no!

310
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,108
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

311
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,780
- Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

312
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:38,686
Why? Why me?

313
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:42,663
Because you took 300 bottles
of shampoo?

314
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:47,194
I guess things were
just going too well for me.

315
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:50,869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

316
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:56,407
- Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and--
- Oh, not another one!

317
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:02,682
Oh, my God-- Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

318
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:07,915
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

319
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:14,421
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- You think?

320
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:20,266
Okay. Bye.

321
00:24:20,437 --> 00:24:23,702
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

322
00:24:23,874 --> 00:24:27,901
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so....

323
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:32,378
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

324
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:37,449
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

325
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:40,089
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

326
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,153
All right.

327
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,024
Susie-- Can I call you Susie?

328
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:50,556
My name is Precious.

329
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,565
I can't say that.

330
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:57,897
Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

331
00:24:58,308 --> 00:25:02,301
Mike and I are back together.
And unfortunately...

332
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:06,176
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

333
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,051
He's very sorry about that, and wishes
you the best luck in all your endeavors.

334
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:17,627
I just can't believe this. Why?

335
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,886
- Well, I don't--
- Why would he do this?

336
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:22,794
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

337
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:25,058
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

338
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,466
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

339
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:31,733
Have some pride, for the love of God!

340
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,274
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

341
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:43,317
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

342
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:48,550
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

343
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:54,092
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

344
00:25:57,968 --> 00:26:01,165
Look, Precious....

345
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:07,175
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

346
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,835
...and let's face it,
Mike's kind of a wang.

347
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:14,073
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

348
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:16,980
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

349
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:22,023
I don't like to kiss and tell, but
he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

350
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:25,457
Oh, my God, you know, maybe
you're right. Maybe I don't need him.

351
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:28,621
I deserve to be treated with respect.

352
00:26:29,233 --> 00:26:34,899
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

353
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,236
You're welcome.

354
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:51,411
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

355
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:53,522
Not really.

356
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,783
I have a problem.

357
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:01,556
Really? What happened?

358
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:07,260
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...

359
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:11,401
...and I got stuck.

360
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:15,411
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move.

361
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:24,454
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

362
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:26,555
I guess so.

363
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:32,926
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

364
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,257
- Hey.
- Hi.

365
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:41,994
- So? Did you tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

366
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:45,335
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

367
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:48,568
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

368
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:52,237
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

369
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,510
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

370
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,916
"l didn't mean it.

371
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,417
I'm so sorry."

372
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,962
Yeah, because that's what we do.

373
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:12,392
All right, all right, okay. How about this?
How about this? Tomorrow....

374
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:16,361
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

375
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,235
Okay, that sounds fair.

376
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:21,206
- That just means, once again, we can't--
- I know.

377
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:25,246
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

378
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:29,442
- No! Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

379
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,453
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

380
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:35,421
Yep. Good night.

381
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:44,090
Good night.

382
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:47,096
Good night.

383
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:56,508
- Seriously, good night.
- Stop saying good night.

384
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,231
I'm so sorry.

385
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,403
Look what I found in the drawer.

386
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:33,549
And you said I'd never wear this.

387
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:38,046
Now that I untangled you, how about
you do a little something for me?

388
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:41,987
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

389
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,324
- Really? I don't-- I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

390
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,890
Okay.

391
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:53,432
I just don't get why you like it so much.

392
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:57,095
She's an FBl agent posing
as a beauty contestant!
