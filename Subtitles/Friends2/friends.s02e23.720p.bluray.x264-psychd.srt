1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,838
Okay, Chandler, Mon,
there's only one banana-nut muffin left.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,423
I ordered mine first.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,466
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,344
Give it to me.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,679
No.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,930
Give it to me.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,933
Okay, you can have it.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,193
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,363
That was there when I got here.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,870
Hey, you guys, you will never guess
who's coming to New York.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,164
Quick, Phoebe,
tell us before he swallows.

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,458
Ryan, that guy I went out with
who's in the Navy.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,211
You went out with a guy in the Navy?

14
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,839
Yeah, I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

15
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,551
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,054
Hey, is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

17
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,389
No. Heh.

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,518
No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces, like, every couple years...

19
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,480
...and we have the most amazing
three days together.

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:09,193
Only this time, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yay. "

21
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,989
So wait, this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

22
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,078
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

23
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,709
Hi.

24
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,711
Oh, no. What happened?

25
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,380
I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chicken pox.

26
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,799
Oh, no. You're kidding.

27
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,260
Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you're gonna get it.

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,054
- Well, I've had it.
- Yeah, I've had it.

29
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,222
- Had it.
- Had it.

30
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,101
I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look.

31
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,324
Honey, you made the bed again.

32
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,828
I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

33
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,124
Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

34
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,835
Okay, I am going to take a shower.

35
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,338
And today I will be singing
Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown. "

36
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,225
Monica?

37
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,936
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

38
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,190
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,317
...or the fattest man
in the whole damn town?

40
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:18,405
The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown. "

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,991
What are you doing?

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,078
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

43
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,583
Are you remaking the bed?

44
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,503
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what?
The way you did it, it was just fine.

45
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,131
Then you're redoing it because?

46
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,050
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

47
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,303
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

48
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,932
Okay. You see...

49
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,228
...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

50
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,480
...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,608
- Uh-huh. Well, that's not so crazy.
- I'm just easing you in.

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,610
Ha. All right.

53
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,321
All right, you see these
little flower blossoms?

54
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,782
They should be facing up, not down...

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,452
...because, well, the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

56
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,208
You don't love me anymore, do you?

57
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,546
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

58
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,757
Really?

59
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,302
Wow. Well, then, come on.

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,889
I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

61
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,229
Joey, if you need something
to hold you over...

62
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,148
...I can get you a job right here
as an entry-level processor.

63
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,317
Don't you need experience
for a job like that?

64
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,902
It's not that hard to learn.

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,864
And as for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.

66
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,535
Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,205
Hey, Chandler.
Here's this morning's projections.

68
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,374
Hey, thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

69
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,625
- Hey
Hey.

70
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,086
Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.

71
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,879
No kidding?

72
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,465
Oh, yeah.

73
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,595
I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

74
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,225
- Where do you work?
- Uh, well, right now I'm in between things.

75
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,937
You know how it is. One day
you're processing, the next day...

76
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,940
...you're not so much
processing anymore.

77
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,651
I was telling Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

78
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,403
Fleischman's group.

79
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,072
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,037
Are all you processors dorks?

81
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,837
Ugh. This lipstick looks
just great on you.

82
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,548
You look fabulous, honey. You really do.

83
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,216
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

84
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,556
See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

85
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,310
I'm hideous.

86
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,020
It's gonna be okay.

87
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,897
Ryan's been underwater.

88
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,484
He's just gonna be so glad
that you don't have barnacles on your butt.

89
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,623
Come in.

90
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, baby, I'm back...

91
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,378
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

92
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,006
What's going on?

93
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,594
No, no. You have to stay back.
I have the pox.

94
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,265
Chicken or small?

95
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,269
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

96
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,358
- Why aren't you at home in bed?
- My grandmother's never had chicken pox.

97
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,944
Please, please, tell me you have...

98
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,072
...because oh, my God,
I forgot how cute you are.

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,158
- I'm sorry, I never had them.
- Oh, oh!

100
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,247
If I had one wish, it'd be to build
a time machine, go back to when I was 7...

101
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,998
...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...

102
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,252
...I would grab that kid
and rub him all over my face.

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,880
Yeah, or, you know, you could
just wish that I didn't have them now.

104
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,674
Can I please see your face?

105
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,718
No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

106
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,138
Your face could be covered with lox,
I wouldn't care.

107
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,141
And you hate fish. Oh.

108
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,061
So sweet. All right.

109
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,897
Okay, all right. You can see.

110
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,150
This, ahem, is me.

111
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,698
Sorry.

112
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,366
I am scary.

113
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,784
Sorry, the lightning...

114
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,162
Lightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

115
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,206
You look lovely. Lovely.

116
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,583
I hate this.

117
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,336
I tell you, I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

118
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,923
And almost everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

119
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,429
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

120
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,641
...thinking about this moment.

121
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,436
I am not gonna let a bunch...

122
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,855
...of itchy spots stand between us.

123
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,782
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

124
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,707
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the first day going?

125
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,209
Pretty good. It's like you said.

126
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,420
It's mostly just putting numbers
from one column into another column.

127
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,671
Well, there you go.

128
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,298
Hey, and everybody's so nice.

129
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,426
I just had a good talk with that lady
with the red hair, Jeannie.

130
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,596
Jeannie? The head of
East Coast Operations, Jeannie?

131
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,225
Yeah. Turns out our kids
go to the same school.

132
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,355
Yeah. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.

133
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,024
Weird world.

134
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,653
- Your kids?
- I figure my character has kids.

135
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,116
You know, there isn't a part of that
sentence that I don't need explained.

136
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,287
Well, see, when you're acting,
you need to think about stuff like that.

137
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,873
My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,169
...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

139
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,965
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

140
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,974
Oh. Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

141
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:24,854
Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife,
Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.

142
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,815
You know what?

143
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,984
Just did.

144
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,780
Really, wow. That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

145
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,001
You know what makes the itching
even worse?

146
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,296
That you don't stop talking about it?

147
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,091
- Fine.
- Let's just play, okay?

148
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,384
Good, okay.

149
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,845
Here we go, double sixes.

150
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,472
Here we go...

151
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,391
Here we go.

152
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,936
Come to Mama.
Just getting ready to roll the dice.

153
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,564
What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

154
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,609
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

155
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,153
You're scratching.

156
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,779
- Give me the dice.
- No.

157
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,282
- Give me the dice.
- No. Here. There.

158
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,950
Look, double sixes.

159
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,787
We can't scratch. You know we can't.
We'll scar.

160
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,250
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

161
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,545
I just wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

162
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,297
- No. No.
- Give it.

163
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,757
Come on.

164
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,843
You know you want it.
You know you want it too. Come on.

165
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,220
Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.

166
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,056
Oh, come on. Come on.

167
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,183
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, God, help me.

168
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,644
- Uh-huh. Good, huh?
- Yeah.

169
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,063
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, good. Now do me.

170
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,066
Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder.

171
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,275
There you go.

172
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,526
- Don't move.
- Why?

173
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,028
- Don't move.
- What are you?

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,327
Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.

175
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,621
You know, I might've expected this
of you, Phoebe.

176
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,706
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

177
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,672
You and Milton
have to join us on the boat.

178
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,716
Karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids.
We'll make a day of it.

179
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,719
Oh, that sounds lovely.
We're gonna have to set that up.

180
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,639
Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

181
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,557
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

182
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,768
- Bye-bye, Jeannie. Ha, ha.
Bye-bye, Joseph.

183
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,145
What a phony.

184
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,443
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson
when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

185
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,738
- Hey, Mr. Douglas.
- Sir.

186
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,532
Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.

187
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,410
So we're not gonna see
the report until next Friday?

188
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,246
Well, the people in my group
want to spend the holiday with family.

189
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,249
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

190
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,668
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

191
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,759
It's about cutting my people
a little slack, you know, for morale.

192
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,762
If you wanna see some rough numbers,
I can get them to you by Wednesday.

193
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,265
Rough numbers?

194
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,228
This company was not built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

195
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,690
Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

196
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,067
If you say so, sir.

197
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,820
Joseph's good, isn't he?

198
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,532
Well, I'm going to kill you.

199
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:28,204
Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

200
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,541
You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

201
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,085
Why?

202
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,466
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

203
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,760
Okay? If you try to pull something...

204
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,845
...he'll call you on it.

205
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,389
"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.

206
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,062
Ooh. Duct tape.

207
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,523
Was I supposed to bring something too?

208
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,862
This is for the scratchy twins out there.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

209
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,490
You're strict.

210
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,700
Yeah, well, it's for their own good.

211
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:10,622
You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

212
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,959
See, in a tape emergency, you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

213
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,421
Exactly. Oh.

214
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,884
God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

215
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,594
- Tell me the truth.
- Hmm.

216
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,931
Don't you like it better that everything
on your desk is perpendicular?

217
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:31,309
If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

218
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,561
- Very good.
- Thank you.

219
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,231
You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

220
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,025
You're gonna do what to my clocks?

221
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,735
I'm gonna set them to my time.

222
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,572
Well, I'm confused.

223
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,866
I thought we shared time.

224
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:52,038
No, no. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

225
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,206
You wanna know why?

226
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,836
Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

227
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,797
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, come on, come on, tell me.

228
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,715
- No, you don't understand.
- No, come on.

229
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,009
No, you don't have any of these
cute obsessive things.

230
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,095
No, that's not true. That is not true.

231
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,429
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,098
All right, well, tell me one of yours.

233
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,850
Okay.

234
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,396
Ah.

235
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:21,025
One of my things is,
I always separate my sweat socks...

236
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,903
...from my dress socks.

237
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,157
- Yeah.
- What if they get mixed up?

238
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,660
Boy, I would just, uh...

239
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,495
I would freak out.

240
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,374
You would not.

241
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,961
I can't believe this. I hate this.
You're too normal.

242
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,338
I can't believe my boyfriend
doesn't have a thing.

243
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,049
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

244
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,469
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well there.

245
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,227
Hey.

246
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,525
- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
- Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

247
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,779
Because he has a strong suspicion that
you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

248
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,241
Why? Why does he suspect that?

249
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,786
Because at first,
he thought it was Joseph...

250
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,415
...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

251
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,879
- Anyway, I just thought you should know.
- All right. That's it.

252
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,547
Look, Joey...

253
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,508
...I'm sorry, I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

254
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,011
...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.

255
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,971
But unfortunately that's not possible.

256
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,806
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

257
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,936
What are you talking about?
Everybody loves Joseph.

258
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,146
I don't. I hate Joseph.

259
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,650
Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

260
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,110
Oh, yeah?

261
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,029
Well, you can't fire Joseph.
You know why?

262
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,405
He's not in your department.

263
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,331
All right, okay.
All right, so I can't fire Joseph...

264
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,124
...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.

265
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,672
- Not Karen.
- Yeah, Karen.

266
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,009
I'm thinking about having an affair
with her. Oh, you know what?

267
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,970
I just did.

268
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,474
What the hell are you doing to me, man?

269
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,976
Oh, it's not me.

270
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,477
It's my character.

271
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,980
Chandie.

272
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,359
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives for sport...

273
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,444
...and then laughs about it the next day.

274
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,115
In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer.

275
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,701
- Really?
- No, freak show, she's fictional!

276
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,912
Come on! Hey. Take it easy.

277
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,250
If it means that much to you,
I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.

278
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,585
Thank you.

279
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,924
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

280
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,052
I liked him. His wife.

281
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,804
She was hot.

282
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,598
Ow.

283
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,020
Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

284
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,522
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

285
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,484
Well, that wasn't easy.

286
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,071
Okay, dinner's on.

287
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,949
And there's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

288
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,203
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

289
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,665
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

290
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,751
- Bye.
Oh, look, look.

291
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,794
A low-budget puppet show.

292
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,965
It's such a shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

293
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,300
All right.

294
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,931
- Wine?
- Please.

295
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,902
- Oh. Spilled some.
- I got it.

296
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,499
I must tell you,
you look beautiful tonight.

297
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,667
What?

298
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,545
Sorry.

299
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,216
You look beautiful.

300
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,675
Oh.

301
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,735
You know what? That's it. That's it.

302
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,910
Oh! Oh!

303
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,788
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

304
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,373
Good.

305
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,004
You guys, did you...?

306
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,142
Monica, wake up.

307
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,602
- Monica.
- What's up?

308
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,146
I thought of a thing.

309
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,866
I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

311
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,495
No, honey. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

312
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,456
...because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

313
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,044
Or so I would have you believe.

314
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:39,218
No. Big deal. So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

315
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,638
Hey, come on.
You haven't heard my reason yet.

316
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,600
- All right, go on.
- Okay.

317
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,311
I have to sleep on the west side...

318
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,522
...because I grew up in California...

319
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,524
...and otherwise...

320
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,986
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

321
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,786
- Oh, my God. You're a freak.
- Yeah.

322
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,164
How about that?

323
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,254
- So, Ryan, where are you shipping off to?
- I really can't say.

324
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,673
So do you have any
nuclear weapons onboard?

325
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,592
I can't say.

326
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,553
Well, do you get to look through
one of those periscope thingies?

327
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,722
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

328
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,850
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

329
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,478
I better get out of here.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

330
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,854
Okay, I'll walk you out.

331
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,565
Bye, Ryan.
- Pleasure. Take care.

332
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:44,492
So do you, uh, think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

333
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,245
You like that, do you?

334
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,372
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll make some calls.

335
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,831
Okay.

336
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,127
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

337
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,171
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

338
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,009
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.

339
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,719
Oh, I just got that.

340
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,647
Taxi.

341
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,529
Bye, you.

342
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm sorry, we're clo...

343
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,173
Hey, sailor.

344
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,967
Is this what you had in mind?

345
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,428
Ha, ha. I'll say.

346
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,853
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

347
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,063
Well, then, uh...

348
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,525
...we better make this night count.

349
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,780
Oh, wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

350
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,333
Anchors aweigh.

351
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,087
Oh, wait. My purse, my purse, my purse.

352
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,429
Oh, you know what?
I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

353
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,806
All right,
why don't I just meet you upstairs?

354
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,188
Honey.
