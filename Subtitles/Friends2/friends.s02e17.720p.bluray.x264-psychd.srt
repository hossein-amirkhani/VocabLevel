1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,465
Huh? So, what do you think?

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,843
Casa de Joey.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,095
Huh? I decorated it myself.

4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,972
- Get out.
No.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,142
Wow, Joey, this is, uh...

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,144
- Art.
- Art it is.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,732
Well, check this out.
Is it a coffee table?

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,193
Is it, uh, a panther?
There's no need to decide.

9
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,197
Hey, nice pillow.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,242
So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

11
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,413
Hey, excellent water-table thing.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,874
Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,209
It makes me want to pee.

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,005
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge. Heh.

15
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,634
Hey, how come, uh,
Chandler didn't come?

16
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,722
Well, uh, it's because he had
a thing with the...

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,057
With the thing.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,186
Right. I got it.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,647
Why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

20
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,899
Yeah.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,069
Uh, oh, oh, the best part. Come on.

22
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,823
Huh?

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,659
Hey.

24
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,704
Nice toilet.

25
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,623
No, no, no. Behind it.

26
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,542
- You have a phone in here?
- That's right.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,002
I have a phone.

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,129
In here.

29
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,049
- Joey, promise me something.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,468
Never call me from that phone.

31
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,905
Okay, here we go.

32
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,369
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,415
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You are not gonna believe this.

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,459
I have just been discovered.

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,548
Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

36
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,386
Anyway.

37
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,307
Promise you won't freak out
and say how great this is until I'm done.

38
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,558
Okay.
- Okay.

39
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,936
Uh, I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

40
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,106
...who said, ahem, that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

41
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,651
...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat. "

42
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,822
Okay, I told you not to do that yet.
Ha, ha.

43
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,365
Okay.

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,951
And she wants to do a video.

45
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.

46
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,458
God. Okay.

47
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,712
If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

48
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,800
- I'm done now.
Oh, that's great.

49
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,303
That's unbelievable. Oh.

50
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,890
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

51
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,851
- Get the what?
- There's a pie in the hood. Go.

52
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:59,112
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

53
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,326
I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

54
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,037
...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

55
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,545
Damn it, Ross.
Get your butt out of the bathroom.

56
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,758
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

57
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,303
Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,847
What's going on?

59
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,558
Uh, your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour.

60
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,644
It's like I'm living with him again.

61
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,897
He's here when I go to sleep,
when I wake up, when I wanna shower.

62
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,650
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.

63
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,736
Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

64
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,947
Get out, you doofus!

65
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,786
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

66
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,708
All yours.

67
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,627
I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

68
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,755
I hope
you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

69
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,924
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

70
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,509
Cut it out.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,184
I've never wanted you more.

72
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,656
So, what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

73
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,748
You know what they say:

74
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,083
Ask your slippers a question...

75
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,670
...you're going crazy.

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,302
- Hello?
Hey.

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,553
Hey.

78
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,264
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

79
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh, that's okay.

80
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,393
You, uh... You had a thing.

81
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,896
Yeah, well,
I hear the place looks great.

82
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,649
Oh, forget about it.
I'm having a ball, ha.

83
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,610
How's the apartment doing?

84
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,280
Oh, hey, it's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space...

85
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,492
...fest.

86
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,828
Oh, well, great.

87
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,080
Yeah, I just...

88
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,916
...wanted to call and say hey.

89
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,502
Well, okay, then.

90
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,421
Was that the oven timer?

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,465
That's right, my friend.

92
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,760
- It's time for Baywatch!
- Baywatch!

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,722
Oh.

94
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,308
Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,061
I can't believe
they promoted her to lieutenant.

96
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,399
You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

97
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,610
How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

98
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,988
Hey. Hey, they're running.

99
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,201
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

100
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,328
I say always keep them running.

101
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,623
All the time running.

102
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,669
Run.

103
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,463
Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.

104
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,384
But you wanted to live by yourself.

105
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,303
I did. I thought it'd be great.

106
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,682
I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

107
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,436
But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

108
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,940
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

109
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,067
You really think he'd take me?

110
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,236
We had a good talk last night...

111
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,697
...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

112
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,491
I promise you,
he would definitely want you back.

113
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,035
I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

114
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,498
But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night. Heh.

115
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,375
I mean, it was...

116
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,628
It was like when we first
started living together.

117
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,840
Look, I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

118
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,011
...but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

119
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,264
He's decorated.

120
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,227
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

121
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,148
No, you're just gonna have to accept
the fact that you're just friends now.

122
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,774
You're not...

123
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,651
...roommates anymore.

124
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,739
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?

125
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,741
Okay. Ahem.

126
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,579
Smelly cat, smelly cat

127
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,540
What are they feeding you?

128
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,709
Smelly, smelly, smelly

129
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,211
Really bad smelling smelly cat

130
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,587
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!

131
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,884
I mean, like, who was that?

132
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,097
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

133
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,849
Oh.

134
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,769
Oh, I thought
they were just watching me.

135
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,606
- Like at an aquarium, you know?
- All right.

136
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,693
- From the top.
- Okay. Ahem.

137
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,072
Smelly cat, smelly cat

138
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,033
What are they feeding you?

139
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,743
Smelly, smelly, smelly

140
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,620
Really bad smelling smelly cat

141
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,247
It's not your fault

142
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,498
Okay, sorry.

143
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,333
I'm just not getting...

144
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,835
...that everyone, um, gets...

145
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,297
...how smelly this cat actually is.

146
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,383
Maybe if we could talk about this...

147
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,178
...because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

148
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,431
Honey, we can talk about this.

149
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,685
It's just that it's costing
about $100 a minute to be in here.

150
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,604
Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

151
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,110
No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

152
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,237
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

153
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,824
If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

154
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,243
Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,036
Oh, were you taking a nap?

156
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,038
- I was.
- Oh, I...

157
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,958
Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

158
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,251
Hello?

159
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,462
Yeah, she's here,
but, uh, can she call you back?

160
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,172
Okay, thanks.

161
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,507
Call Joanna. Hi.

162
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:53,883
Did she leave a number?

163
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,386
Did you see me write one down?

164
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,931
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,269
Well, she'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

166
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,812
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.

167
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,315
- Look, you wanna get off my back?
- Get out of my face.

168
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,192
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

169
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,111
Hello?

170
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,654
Hi.

171
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,532
Yeah, no, she's right here.
Um, hold on.

172
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,784
Hi, Tony, can I call you back?

173
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,621
That's, uh...
That's my sister's boyfriend.

174
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,497
Give me that.

175
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,499
Okay.

176
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,796
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave
my diaphragm at your place?

177
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,258
Hi, Mom.

178
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,276
Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.

179
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,282
So, uh, how's the palace?

180
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,995
It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking...

181
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,830
What's with the boxes?

182
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,418
Oh, uh, actually,
I, uh, have some news.

183
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,422
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

184
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,344
Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

185
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,679
Nice to meet you.

186
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,722
- Likewise.
How you doing?

187
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,224
Uh, I'll take that.

188
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,686
It's, uh, what I came for, heh.

189
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,272
So this is new.
Where'd you two meet?

190
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,193
At the, uh, supermarket
in the, uh, ethnic-food section.

191
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,404
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.

192
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,864
- It's a... I mean...
- Wow.

193
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:44,160
We got to talking. And, uh, he needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

194
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,788
Oh, now it's a spare room?

195
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,957
Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

196
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,209
...and I have it to spare.

197
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,585
Right.

198
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,881
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.

199
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,720
I'll, uh... I'll see you guys.

200
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,140
Hey, Joe.

201
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,975
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

202
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,563
Is this guy great, or what?

203
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,648
Yeah.

204
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,400
Yeah, he is.

205
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,243
I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is this guy?

206
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,203
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.

207
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:31,207
It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

208
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,918
- Hey.
Hey.

209
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,838
Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.

210
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,633
- It's "Smelly Cat," the video.
Oh, God.

211
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:45,889
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

212
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,683
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

213
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,022
Okay.

214
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,903
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

215
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,955
Oh, smoking.
- Oh, look at me.

216
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,833
Smelly cat, smelly cat

217
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,545
What are they feeding you?

218
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,382
Smelly cat, smelly cat

219
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,345
It's not your fault

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,724
Smelly, smelly, smelly

221
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,852
Really bad smelling smelly cat
It's not your fault

222
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,855
Smelly cat, smelly cat

223
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,191
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

224
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,401
I sound amazing!

225
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,199
They won't take you to the vet

226
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,660
You're obviously not their favorite pet

227
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,412
Smelly cat, smelly cat

228
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,498
It's not your fault

229
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,543
Oh, no

230
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,128
I've never heard myself sing before.

231
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,006
I mean, except in my own head. Oh.

232
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,051
This is so cool.
Now I can hear what you hear.

233
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,930
Pretty, uh, different, huh?

234
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,851
Oh, I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented.

235
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,397
Smelly cat, smelly cat

236
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,858
It's not your fault

237
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,537
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?

238
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,080
Eddie.

239
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,416
- Morning.
- Morning.

240
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,752
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.

241
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,464
- Where's the mail?
- Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.

242
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,217
You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

243
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,094
No, Eddie likes it over there.

244
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,894
All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs à la Eddie, huh.

245
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,521
Ooh. Ooh.

246
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,692
Oh, oh. That's great.

247
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,360
Huh.

248
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,070
What?

249
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,156
I thought you liked your eggs...

250
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,659
...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, à la me.

251
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,830
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

252
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,290
Well, you guys...

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,626
...I'm out of here.

254
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,419
See you, pals.

255
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,087
See you.

256
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,260
- So how are you two getting along?
- Oh, I couldn't be happier.

257
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,970
Great, huh?

258
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,222
I'm happy for you.

259
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,560
All right, that's it!

260
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,607
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

261
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,736
...with his moving the mail and his:

262
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,905
"See you, pals. "

263
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,201
And now there's no juice!

264
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,704
There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

265
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,249
There's another carton
right over there.

266
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,963
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

267
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,339
All right.

268
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,632
So, what's it about?

269
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,759
Eggs.

270
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,637
Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine, huh?

271
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,556
- Well, I like both eggs equally.
- Oh, come on!

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,101
Nobody likes
two kinds of eggs equally.

273
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,436
You like one better,
and I wanna know which.

274
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,314
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

275
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,485
You took your eggs, and you left!

276
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,446
Did you really expect me
to never find new eggs?

277
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,701
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

278
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,495
Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

279
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,998
- Ugh.
- Would you guys stop?

280
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,125
- It's my TV!
What?

281
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,543
- Quit it.
- Bite me!

282
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,794
Oh, my God.

283
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,963
Well, Monica keeps changing
the channel.

284
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,591
Aw, that's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

285
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,886
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

286
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,723
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

287
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,642
...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

288
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,687
So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

289
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,024
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

290
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,319
What do we do about this?

291
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,530
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

292
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,781
Not that!

293
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,700
This! Us!

294
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,494
Oh, my God, Ross, it's... You're just...

295
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,247
- Since you've been here, you're driving...
- Ow, ow.

296
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,667
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

297
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,087
I just can't stand you being here...

298
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,505
...all the time!

299
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,800
Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

300
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,343
We're just having fun.

301
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,180
Fun? You think this is fun?

302
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,431
Yeah.

303
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,018
I thought we were fooling around,
like when, uh... When we were kids.

304
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,103
I hated you when we were kids.

305
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,066
- You hated me when we were kids?
- Yes.

306
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,484
I hated you.

307
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,236
I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-I-have-to way...

308
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,405
...but basically, I hated your guts.

309
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,200
Why did you hate me?

310
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,244
Because you were mean to me...

311
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,873
...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

312
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,251
That wasn't fun for you?

313
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,254
Uh-huh.

314
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,466
I can't believe you hated me.

315
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,178
But now I love you.

316
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,265
And not just because I have to.

317
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,725
Really?

318
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,393
Yeah.

319
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,231
You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

320
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,153
I can do that.

321
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,156
- Then I won't have to kill you.
- Ha, ha.

322
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,121
So you wanna watch, uh,
Entertainment Tonight?

323
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,164
Yeah, thanks.

324
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,333
Tonight, America's premier
sports magazine...

325
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,626
...moves to primetime...

326
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,586
- You know what?
- What?

327
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,714
If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

328
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,050
Oh, okay.

329
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,433
- Hey.
Hey.

330
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,228
Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

331
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,857
...but, ahem, that is not me
singing on the video.

332
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,526
No.

333
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,111
Yes.

334
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,779
Well, how did you find out?

335
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:21,325
The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

336
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,288
...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

337
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,373
So, what are you gonna do?

338
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,084
I can't work with people
who would do this.

339
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,460
Sure.

340
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,171
I mean, this poor woman.

341
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,339
What woman?

342
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,716
The voice woman.

343
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,886
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

344
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,805
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

345
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,974
I have a video. Pay attention.

346
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,022
No, this voice woman,
she's so talented.

347
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,649
But according to the producer people...

348
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,528
...they said, like, she doesn't have
the right look or something. You know?

349
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,947
She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

350
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,366
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

351
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,954
Or, you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and...

352
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,207
Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!

353
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,712
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.

354
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,549
Hey, Eddie.

355
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,593
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?

356
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,512
No, thanks, man.
I'm not, uh... Not really into sports.

357
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,728
Yeah, okay. All right.

358
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,774
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch.

359
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,776
Oh, what?

360
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,861
You like that show?

361
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,615
You don't?

362
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,617
Ha, ha, what...? No.

363
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,703
I mean, it's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

364
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,456
Well, that's the brilliance of it.

365
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,627
The pretty people.

366
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,755
And the running.

367
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

368
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,304
Oh, oh. Okay, man.

369
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,738
Smelly cat, smelly cat

370
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,781
What are they feeding you?

371
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,991
Everybody!

372
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,994
Smelly cat, smelly cat

373
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,496
It's not your fault

374
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,040
Monica.

375
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,624
They won't take you to the vet

376
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,418
Chandler.

377
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,839
You're obviously not their favorite pet

378
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,090
Joey.

379
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,010
You may not be a bed of roses

380
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,637
And you're no friend
To those with noses

381
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:35,102
Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Sorry. Okay. Back to the chorus.
