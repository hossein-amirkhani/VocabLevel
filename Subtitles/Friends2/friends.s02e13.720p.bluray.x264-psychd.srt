1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,419
Ah, excuse me, this is a...

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,255
Closed set. We know. But we're
friends with the monkey, hmm?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,259
Good morning.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,052
Look who I brought!

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,179
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,853
Whoa, dude. Burn!

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,396
I don't get it.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,732
He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:29,278
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure,
starring in a movie and all.

10
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,696
Oh.

11
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,948
How big of a star is Marcel?

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,243
In human terms? I'd say...

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,953
...Cybill Shepherd.
Whoa.

14
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,663
Really?
Whoa.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,294
So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

16
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,671
- Hey, Sal?
- Mm-hm?

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,923
Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

18
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,175
Excuse me?

19
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,178
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

20
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,139
- The one in the director's chair?
Gotcha.

21
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,224
Pheebs, walk with me.

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,476
Okay.

23
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,811
Um, why am I walking with you?

24
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,398
Well, uh, we're just going
over here so that we can get away from...

25
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,318
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

26
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,945
For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

27
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,781
Is he looking? Is he looking?

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,504
We've got a problem.
- Tell me.

29
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,006
I can't do Chris' makeup.

30
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,509
She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,262
- Is it bad?
- It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

32
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,598
Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

33
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,434
...Jean-Claude Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

34
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,521
I'll talk to her.

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,772
I hate actors.

36
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,111
Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

37
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,032
- Excuse me. Whoa.
- Ah!

38
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,578
Uh, is your name Chandler?

39
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,621
Uh, yes, it is.

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,914
Chandler Bing.

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,710
Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

42
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,086
I'm Susie Moss.

43
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,714
Fourth grade? Glasses?

44
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,800
I carried a box of animal crackers
like a purse?

45
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,719
Susie Moss!

46
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,929
Right! Yeah! Wow!

47
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,140
You look...

48
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,809
Great job growing up.

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,730
It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

50
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,442
Oh, I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,069
Heh, heh. Remember the class play?

52
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,781
You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

53
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:26,496
Yes. Back then, I, uh, used humor
as a defense mechanism.

54
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,165
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

55
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,464
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

56
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,883
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

57
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,886
I didn't know he was in this movie.
He is so hot!

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,554
You think?

59
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,099
The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

60
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,809
Did you see Timecop?

61
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,478
No. Was he any good in it?

62
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,356
Rachel, he totally changed time!

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,149
Wow.

64
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,361
- So why don't you go talk to him?
- Oh. Yeah.

65
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,656
Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

66
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,115
He could hear me.

67
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,575
Oh.

68
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,453
- I'm doing it for you.
- Don't you dare! Don't!

69
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,829
Don't!

70
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,623
Tell him I cook!

71
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,125
Excuse me.

72
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,585
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

73
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,713
Um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy.
Ha, ha.

74
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,426
But, um, my friend over there...

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,387
...who cooks, by the way...

76
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,056
Um, she thinks you're cute. Heh.

77
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,100
You don't think I'm cute?

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,436
I don't know. Um...

79
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,771
Do you think you're cute?

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,486
We're getting off the track.
Um, I was supposed to tell you...

81
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,155
...my friend thinks you're cute.

82
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,824
What should I tell her?

83
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,704
You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

84
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,125
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Huh?

85
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,336
Whoa. Ha, ha.

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,255
Makeup!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go.

87
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,132
Oh, uh...

88
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,842
Okay.

89
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:08,098
Um, how many times do I have to touch you
on the arm before you ask me on a date?

90
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,019
Well, uh, let's try one more.

91
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,814
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

92
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,399
I'll be there.

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,193
And if things go well,
maybe this time...

94
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,446
...I'll get to see your underwear.

95
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,662
No one was around to hear that?

96
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,502
- So, what'd he say?
- Ugh!

97
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,837
What a jerk!

98
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,133
I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

99
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,177
Oh.

100
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,305
Naturally, you know, I said no.

101
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,350
Well...

102
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,601
Thanks, anyway.

103
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,478
He just kept asking...

104
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,230
...and asking, asking, asking...

105
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,858
If you want to go out with him, you can.

106
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,320
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...

107
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,822
Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

108
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,702
Thank you.

109
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,295
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...

110
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,672
...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,133
Oh, man. She's so smoking!

112
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,135
She's got the greatest set of...

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,973
No guys around, huh?

114
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,478
- Anybody need anything?
- Oh, I'll have an espresso.

115
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,230
Oh, I'll get it.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,691
If I ask you to,
you'll end up drinking it yourself.

117
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,613
- That is so unfair.
- I know.

118
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,826
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,913
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

120
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,375
Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

121
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,377
You're blowing me off for a monkey?

122
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,337
We can reschedule for Saturday.

123
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,216
Yeah, unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

124
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,051
Hey.

125
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,678
Stick a fork in me...

126
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,929
...I am done!

127
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,431
Uh...

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,932
Stick a fork what?

129
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,143
Like when you're cooking a steak.

130
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,103
Oh, I don't eat meat.

131
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,898
How do you know vegetables are done?

132
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:25,193
Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

133
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,154
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

134
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,864
Mm.

135
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,617
- I've met the perfect woman.
- What?

136
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,662
We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

137
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,206
...and then she turns to me and says:

138
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,167
"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

139
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,086
What did you say?

140
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,588
I believe my exact words were:

141
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,635
How do you know if you wanna do that?

142
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,887
Oh, you just know.

143
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,397
Oh, we gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

144
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,107
No, no, no.

145
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,487
What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

146
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,741
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

147
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,410
But, um...

148
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,121
...here's an idea.

149
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,209
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

150
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,794
Well, yes, actually...

151
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,757
...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.

152
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,968
And there were three of us in there.

153
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,889
I was thinking
it would be, um, kind of sexy...

154
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,392
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

155
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,358
You want me to wear your panties?

156
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,943
Could you?

157
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,903
If I was wearing your underwear...

158
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,240
...then, uh, what would you be wearing?

159
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,498
You're swell!

160
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,753
I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

161
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,046
- Ooh.
... with mealworm.

162
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,510
Ah.

163
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,221
- Candle. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

164
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,224
What do you think is
gonna happen here tonight?

165
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,188
Hello.

166
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,649
Oh, hi, are you on your way over...?

167
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,111
Oh.

168
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,615
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

169
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,285
It's no big deal.

170
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:43,290
It's not like I, uh, had anything
special planned, you know.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,086
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.

172
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,679
Okay. Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

173
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,932
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.

174
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,269
She gave me the green light,
I did nothing...

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,274
Do you think I can't see you
in the TV set?

176
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,822
Monica, if there's something
you'd like to share...

177
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,657
You had no right to date him!

178
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,952
- That's the most ridiculous...
- You sold me out!

179
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,954
- I did not!
- You absolutely...

180
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,123
Would you let me talk!

181
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,711
Did you just flick me?

182
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,257
Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was...

183
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,594
- Ow, that hurt!
- Ow.

184
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,262
Quit flicking!

185
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,597
Ow! Stop flicking!

186
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,432
You flicked me first!

187
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,683
Ow!

188
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,435
Ow!

189
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,730
Okay, no, no.

190
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,981
Let's not do this!

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,652
- Come on. Happy thoughts.
No! No!

192
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,570
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!

193
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,448
No! Ow! No!

194
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,076
Oh! Oh!
Oh, God!

195
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,371
Oh! Ow!

196
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,414
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

197
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,001
- Ow.
- Ow.

198
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,256
Ow, ow, ow.

199
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,219
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

200
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:23,431
- Oh! You want me to stop seeing him?
- Uh-huh.

201
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,976
You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

202
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,188
- Is that what you want?
- Okay.

203
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,441
Oh, that's what you want?

204
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,693
Yes.

205
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,321
- Fine!
- Fine!

206
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,906
There we go.

207
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,157
- Ow.
- Oh.

208
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,744
Ha. If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

209
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,839
Thanks for letting me tag along.

210
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,340
Forget about it.

211
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,137
- How you doing there, squirmy?
- I'm hanging in.

212
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,222
And a little out.

213
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,186
So assistant to the director?

214
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,232
That's an exciting job.
You must have a ton of responsibilities...

215
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,942
I don't do the casting.

216
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,027
So, what are you guys gonna eat?

217
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,450
How come all I can think about
is putting that ice in my mouth...

218
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,203
...and licking you all over?

219
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:33,251
Because I went to an all-boys high school,
and God is making up for it?

220
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,466
I want you right here...

221
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,301
...right now.

222
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,553
Right now, right here?

223
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,347
Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

224
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,019
They do have the shrimp.

225
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,898
- Oh.
- Meet me in the bathroom.

226
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,073
I'm going to the bathroom now.

227
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,043
Come on.

228
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,755
All right, mister.

229
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,132
Let's see those panties.

230
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,968
Alrighty.

231
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,055
Ooh. Ooh.

232
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,433
But you know what would be even sexier?

233
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,185
What?

234
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,271
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

235
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,941
Oh.

236
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:42,570
All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

237
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,073
Take your clothes off.

238
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,492
But, uh, I hope you realize this means...

239
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,661
...we'll miss hearing about the specials.

240
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,705
Come on, hurry!

241
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,959
Do you want this done quick or done right?

242
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,838
All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

243
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,968
Oh, oh. Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

244
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,596
So you want me
to, uh, clench anything or?

245
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,644
Susie?

246
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,063
This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.

247
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,402
- Huh? What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

248
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,653
What do I mean?

249
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,489
I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

250
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,033
What? What do you mean?

251
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,535
My skirt...

252
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,454
...you lifted. Kids laughing!

253
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,291
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

254
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,629
That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

255
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,006
Well, um...

256
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,260
Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

257
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,727
I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

258
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,363
I can't believe this. Ha, ha.

259
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,909
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

260
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,662
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

261
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,372
Can you beat up that guy?

262
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,957
Yeah.

263
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,543
- Can you beat up that guy?
- Sure.

264
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,212
Oh, this is so wild.

265
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,509
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

266
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,637
Normally, I would not do it.

267
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,888
Yeah?

268
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,224
What made you make the exception for me?

269
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,517
Rachel told me, uh...

270
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,438
...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.

271
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,858
By the way,
Drew has some ground rules and...

272
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,779
- Say you're sorry!
- No!

273
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,947
Say it!

274
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,990
No! I'm not gonna!

275
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,244
- Say it! Say it! Great!
- Oh!

276
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,205
Rachel.

277
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,333
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

278
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,129
That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

279
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,509
Say you're sorry.

280
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,971
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

281
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,305
Let's play.

282
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,062
What are you gonna do?

283
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,148
Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

284
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,736
You don't have the guts.

285
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,282
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

286
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,587
Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!

287
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,759
This is crazy!

288
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,054
Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

289
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,102
Yes, that's right.

290
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,148
But still...

291
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,816
Look at your purse!

292
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,152
Look at your sweater!

293
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,780
Look at yourselves!

294
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,827
I'll help you fix your sweater.

295
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,954
I'll help you...

296
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,165
...throw out your purse.

297
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,210
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

298
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,089
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

299
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,095
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

300
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,742
Joey?

301
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,660
Ma?

302
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,122
Joey!

303
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,542
What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

304
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,920
She took off with my clothes!

305
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,425
- Are you naked in there?
- Well, not exactly.

306
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,096
I'm wearing panties.

307
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,015
Huh.

308
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,352
You, uh, always wear panties?

309
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,314
No, no. This is the first time.

310
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,776
Wow. Talk about your bad luck!

311
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,322
I mean, the first time you try panties
and someone walks off with your clothes.

312
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,953
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

313
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,621
Let me see!

314
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,250
No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

315
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,502
All right, all right!

316
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,589
Whoa.

317
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,592
Someone's flossing!

318
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,393
Joey, some people don't like that.

319
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,688
Chandler's wearing panties.

320
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,106
What?

321
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,276
- Let me see!
You don't have to see!

322
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,611
Hi, tushy!

323
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,075
- One of you give me your underpants.
- Oh, no.

324
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,535
I'm not wearing any.

325
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,039
How can you not be wearing any?

326
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,002
Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot-pink thong.

327
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,631
Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

328
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,675
Hey.

329
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,828
- Can I have the milk?
- I'm almost done with it.

330
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,079
Keep your panties on.

331
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,878
Hey. Hey.

332
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,255
- And I'm in the movie!
- Hey.

333
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,799
- What happened?
- A virus victim called in sick...

334
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,386
...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

335
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,639
- Hey!
- Oh.

336
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,809
Oh, Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

337
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,398
Uh, that's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

338
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,238
You know, he's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

339
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,074
Oh, my God!

340
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,742
What?

341
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,499
I think I want to write a song about all this.

342
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,543
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

343
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,130
Ooh, except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

344
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,382
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

345
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,178
- How long you been waiting to say that?
- About 20 minutes!

346
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,020
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

347
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,982
Cut!

348
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,485
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

349
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,072
Cut!

350
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,118
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

351
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,748
- Mommy!
- Ah.

352
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,918
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
