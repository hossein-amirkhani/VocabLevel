1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,425
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,427
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,763
Spanish midgets wrestling...

4
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,517
Julie.
Okay, yes, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,484
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,653
No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,532
I figure if I always answer the phone,
people will think I don't have a life.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,035
My God.
Rodrigo never gets pinned.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,912
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,956
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

11
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,332
This is Jade.

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,753
I don't know if you're still at this number,
but I was just thinking about us...

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,049
...and how great it was, and, well,
I know it's been three years...

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,676
...but I was kind of hoping
we could hook up again.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,888
You know, I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

16
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,307
...so you know what I did?
- What?

17
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,517
I got a little drunk...

18
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,727
...and naked.

19
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,228
Bob here.

20
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,738
So, uh, what have you been up to?

21
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,615
Oh, you know, the usual.

22
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,158
Teaching aerobics...

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,203
...partying way too much. Heh.

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,288
Oh, and in case you were wondering...

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,459
...those are my legs
on the new James Bond poster.

26
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,881
Can you hold on a moment?
I have another call.

27
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,758
- I love her.
- I know.

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,138
- I'm back.
So are we gonna get together?

29
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,764
Uh, absolutely.

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,641
Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?

31
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,561
Do you know, uh, Central Perk
in the village? Say, five-ish?

32
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,647
Great. I'll see you then.
- Okay.

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,775
Okay.

34
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,528
Having a phone has finally paid off.

35
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,116
Even though you do
do a good Bob impression...

36
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,118
...I'm thinking when
she sees you tomorrow...

37
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,620
...she's probably gonna realize, hey,
you're not Bob.

38
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,207
I am hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

39
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:52,337
...she will seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next table.

40
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,299
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.

41
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,177
Okay, pure evil...

42
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,637
...horny and alone.

43
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,058
I've done this.

44
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,358
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,820
Hey, everybody.
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

46
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,030
Hi, Julie.

47
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,781
Hi, Julie.

48
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,243
Okay. While Ross is on the phone...

49
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,412
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:30,292
Um, is there any chance
that you're rounding up from...

51
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,838
...you know, from like 20?

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,800
Hey, come on, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

53
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,719
Do we need a cake?

54
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,847
Look, I know it's a little steep.

55
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,515
Whoosh.

56
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,602
But it's Ross.

57
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,231
- Yeah, it's Ross.
Yeah, you're right.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,691
All right? Okay. I'll see you later.
I gotta go...

59
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,568
...do a thing.

60
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,780
Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later tonight.

61
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not
really going through with this, are you?

62
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,535
You know, I think I might just.

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,707
So, uh, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

64
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,962
Well, I guess I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

65
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,840
So I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

66
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,468
Can you believe how much
this is gonna cost?

67
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,930
Do you guys ever get the feeling
that, um...

68
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,556
...Chandler and those guys...

69
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,935
...just don't get that we don't make
as much money as they do?

70
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,311
- Yes.
Really?

71
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,314
It's like they're always saying,
"Let's go here, let's go there. "

72
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,734
- Like we can afford to go here and there.
- Yeah.

73
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:42,114
Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice, you know?

74
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:47,160
It's not like we can say anything about it,
because, like, this is a birthday thing...

75
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,745
...you know, and it's for Ross.

76
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,414
- For Ross.
- For Ross.

77
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,293
Oh, my God.

78
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,627
- Hi.
- What?

79
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,629
Okay. I'm at work...

80
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,008
...just an ordinary day, you know,
chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

81
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,970
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

82
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,181
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef,
and guess who got the job.

83
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,184
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

84
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,730
- Fortunately, it is me.
- Oh.

85
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,357
And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you very much.

86
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,192
That's so cool.

87
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,612
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross.
We should go out and celebrate.

88
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,864
You know, someplace nice.

89
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,872
- Someplace nice.
Yeah.

90
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,833
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

91
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,300
I'm telling you, you can't do this.

92
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:47,512
Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

93
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,805
That doesn't matter.

94
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,349
She wanted to call Bob.

95
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,894
Hey, for all we know,
Bob is who she was meant to be with.

96
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,022
You may be destroying
two people's chance for happiness.

97
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,732
We don't know Bob.

98
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,153
Okay? We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

99
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,491
Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

100
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,659
All right.

101
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,162
Go.

102
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,255
Hi.

103
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,092
Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...

104
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,219
I have to confess something.

105
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,513
Yes?

106
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,725
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

107
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,770
- How did you...
- I don't know.

108
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,193
I just had this weird sense. You know?
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,364
Tissue?

110
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,408
Thanks.

111
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,744
No, no, you keep the pack.

112
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,080
I'm all cried out today.

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,011
Okay, okay.

114
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,391
Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,560
Who is also in charge of purchasing.

116
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,688
Newly appointed head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing...

117
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,191
Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

118
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,821
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing,
own little desk when Roland's not there...

119
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,116
...here's to my little sister...
- Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.

120
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,534
Oh, cool.

121
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,247
- That's fine, I'll just wait.
- Aw, sorry.

122
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,040
Oh, sorry, sorry.

123
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,750
Monica.

124
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,172
Are we ready to order?

125
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,007
Oh. You know,
we haven't even looked yet.

126
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,884
Well, when you do, just let me know.

127
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,011
I'll be right over there
on the edge of my seat.

128
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,935
Wow, look at these prices.

129
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,771
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching. "

130
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,775
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

131
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,738
- Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.
- Thanks.

132
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,074
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible
was my afternoon with Jade?

133
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:17,662
Well, pretty incredible, according to
the message she left on my machine.

134
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,626
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman
leaving a message for you on my machine?

135
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,961
See, I had to tell her
that my number was your number.

136
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,922
I couldn't tell her
my number was my number...

137
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,133
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

138
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,930
Hey, tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

139
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,724
Do I dare ask?

140
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,353
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then I'll have the grilled prawns.

141
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,896
That sounds great, same for me.

142
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,940
And for the gentleman?

143
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,775
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

144
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,111
But, hey, look, if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

145
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,239
...is it cheaper?

146
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,741
You'd think, wouldn't you?

147
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,077
- Miss?
- Okay.

148
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,745
I will have the, uh...

149
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,205
...side salad.

150
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,083
And what would that be on the side of?

151
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,043
I don't know.

152
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,255
Why don't you just put it right here
next to my water?

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,050
And for you?

154
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,846
Um, I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup...

155
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,683
...and, um...

156
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,851
...take care.

157
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,899
- I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.
- Anything else?

158
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,068
Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

159
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,615
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

160
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,999
Plus tip, divided by six...

161
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,210
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.

162
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,255
Um, everyone?

163
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,258
Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.

164
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,467
Thank you.

165
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,344
It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

166
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,597
Aw, thank you.

167
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,473
So five of us is...

168
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,226
...33.50 apiece.

169
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,895
No. Uh-uh. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

170
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,982
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.

171
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,987
Sorry, Monica.
I'm really happy you got promoted...

172
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,407
...but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

173
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,617
No.

174
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,537
Rachel just had that little salad...

175
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,082
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.

176
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,209
Okay, Pheebs.

177
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,504
How about we'll each
just pay for what we had, okay?

178
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,132
- It's no big deal.
- Not for you.

179
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,180
All right, what's going on?

180
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,516
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
get into this right now.

181
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,895
- It'll just make everybody uncomfortable.
- Oh, fine. All right, fine.

182
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,230
- What? Whoa, whoa.
- You can tell us.

183
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,275
Yeah, hello? It's us.
All right? We'll be fine.

184
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,281
Ahem. Okay, um...

185
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,328
Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...

186
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:08,208
...sometimes you guys don't get that,
uh, ahem...

187
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,966
We don't have as much money as you.

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,181
- Okay.
- I hear you.

189
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
We can talk about that.

190
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,228
Well, then...

191
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,147
...let's.

192
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:38,196
Well, um, I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

193
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,573
- That's because you have it.
- That's a good point.

194
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,663
So, um, how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

195
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,041
Because it's always something, you know?
Like with Monica's new job...

196
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,086
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

197
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,213
What? Whoa, hey.

198
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,926
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative...

199
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,011
There's gonna be a hoopla?

200
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:09,102
Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing and it's...

201
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,814
If it makes anybody feel better,
we can just forget the thing...

202
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,066
...and we'll just do the gift.

203
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,902
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

204
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,906
No, the thing was we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

205
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,869
Hootie and the... Oh, my...
I can catch them on the radio.

206
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,039
No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

207
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,667
No, look, hey, it's my birthday...

208
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,045
...and the important thing
is that we all be together.

209
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,422
- All of us.
- Together.

210
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,215
Not at the concert.

211
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,219
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thanks.

212
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,637
Yeah.

213
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,938
So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

214
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,570
Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?

215
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,323
I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

216
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,450
Oh, it's like a skit.

217
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,871
Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

218
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,415
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

219
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,421
We switched meat suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

220
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,842
But wait, there's more.
Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?

221
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,930
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

222
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,348
Come on.

223
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,018
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish.

224
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,648
The Blowfish.

225
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,278
It's on us, all right? So don't worry.
This is our treat.

226
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,031
So... thank you.

227
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,869
Could you be less enthused?

228
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,497
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

229
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,499
But it just feels like...

230
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,000
Like?

231
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,962
- Charity.
- Charity?

232
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,548
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.

233
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:05,844
But, Ross, you have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feel about this big.

234
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,013
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

235
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,811
What? I don't understand. I mean,
it's like we can't win with you guys.

236
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,147
If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

237
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,233
Maybe that's just how you feel.

238
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,402
Oh.

239
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:28,074
- Now you're telling us how we feel.
- We never should have talked about this.

240
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,993
I'm gonna pass on the concert...

241
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,538
...because I'm just not in a very
Hootie place right now.

242
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,376
- Me neither.
- Me too.

243
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,837
Guys, we bought the tickets.

244
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,591
Well, then you'll have extra seats,
you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.

245
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,386
Why did you look at me
when you said that?

246
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,350
So I guess now we can't go.

247
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,897
Come on, do what you want. Do we
always have to do everything together?

248
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,900
You know what? You're right.

249
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,737
- Fine.
- Fine.

250
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,406
- Fine.
- All right.

251
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,075
We're gonna go.

252
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,083
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

253
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,551
- Chandler?
- Yeah.

254
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,345
Oh, jeez.

255
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,305
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

256
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,016
Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

257
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,768
Whoa, whoa.

258
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,063
What? You had sex today?

259
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,608
Wow. It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it.

260
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,280
I was awesome, okay? She was
biting her lip to stop from screaming.

261
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,657
Wow.

262
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,243
Now, I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

263
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,084
Still doing the screening thing?

264
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,211
I had sex today.

265
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,547
I never have to answer that phone again.

266
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,926
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

267
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,136
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

268
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,598
I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn't show up the other day.

269
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,686
And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

270
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,980
Bob here.

271
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,940
Oh, hi.

272
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,401
So, uh, you met someone, huh?

273
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,069
Yes. Yes, I did.

274
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,823
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

275
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,203
So, uh, how was he?

276
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,913
Eh...

277
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,171
"Eh"?

278
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,967
Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

279
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,223
I had to bite my lip to keep
from screaming your name.

280
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,437
Well, that makes me feel so good.

281
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,898
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

282
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,650
Bumpy?

283
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:12,155
Maybe he had some kind of, uh,
new cool style that you're not familiar with.

284
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,574
And, uh,
maybe you have to get used to it.

285
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,909
There wasn't much time to get used to it...

286
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,244
...if you know what I mean.

287
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,091
You know what?
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

288
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,595
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

289
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,805
So let's go.

290
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,689
Well, you know,
maybe we should stay for one song.

291
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,776
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

292
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,986
You know, the guys are probably
having a great time.

293
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:56,157
Every time I look at you
I go blind

294
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,367
Come on, you guys.
One more time.

295
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,702
Okay.

296
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,622
- One.
- No.

297
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,754
Thank you very much.
We are Hootie & The Blowfish.

298
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,549
- That was amazing.
- Excellent.

299
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,468
I can't believe the guys missed this.

300
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,595
What guys? Oh, yeah.

301
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,933
Excuse me.
You're Monica Geller, aren't you?

302
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,769
- Do I know you?
- You used to be my baby-sitter.

303
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,939
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?

304
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,649
How have you been?

305
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,567
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.

306
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,070
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.

307
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,406
Well, listen, it was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

308
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,741
Wait, backstage?

309
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,576
Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.

310
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,286
- Ross.
- Chandler.

311
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,791
- Look, you guys wanna meet the group?
- Yeah, we do.

312
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,000
Come on.

313
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,504
So, look, are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my dad?

314
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,970
- Hey, you guys.
Happy birthday.

315
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,888
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

316
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,224
So, uh...

317
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,102
How was your night last night?

318
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,856
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

319
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,774
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.

320
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,485
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

321
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,779
Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.

322
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,531
Hey, how's his dad?

323
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,993
Good.

324
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,621
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening
was pretty much a bust.

325
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,708
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

326
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,712
Yeah, look, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

327
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:38,009
We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like...

328
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,468
Is that a hickey?

329
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,431
Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...

330
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,391
I fell down.

331
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,478
On someone's lips?

332
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,440
Where'd you get the hickey?

333
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,026
- You know, a party or...
- What party?

334
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,822
Well, it wasn't a party so much as a...
A gathering of people.

335
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,492
With food and music and...

336
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,328
And the band.

337
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,915
You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

338
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,044
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

339
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,588
Who gave you that hickey?

340
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,423
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

341
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,096
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.

342
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,851
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

343
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,106
...and you guys are out, like,
partying and having fun and all:

344
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,442
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck. "

345
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,657
Hey, look, don't blame us.
You guys could've been there.

346
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,993
Oh, what? As part of your
Poor Friends Outreach program?

347
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,038
Oh, great. It's work.

348
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,917
Look, I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry that we make more than you.

349
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,254
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it.
We work really hard for it.

350
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,130
And we don't work hard?

351
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,966
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.

352
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,178
I'm just saying that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

353
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,472
- Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.
- Yes.

354
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,641
No.

355
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,563
Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.

356
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,607
Wait, I don't understand.

357
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,985
Those steaks were just a gift
from the meat vendor.

358
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,945
That was not a kickback.

359
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,782
Come on, I'll just replace them
and we can forget the whole thing.

360
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,995
What corporate policy?

361
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,043
Yeah.

362
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,753
Okay.

363
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,468
I just got fired.

364
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,977
Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.

365
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,437
Let me get that.

366
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,442
You got 5 bucks?

367
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,496
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

368
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,624
Hi, it's me.

369
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,297
Listen, Bob,
I'm probably way out of line here.

370
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,885
I mean, it has been three years, and you're
probably seeing someone else now...

371
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,972
...but if we could just have one night
together, just for old time's sake...

372
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,602
One hot, steamy, wild night...
