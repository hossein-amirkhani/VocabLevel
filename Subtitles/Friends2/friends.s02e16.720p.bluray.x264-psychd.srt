1
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,338
Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,216
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,551
That's what's weird?

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,721
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,766
Whoa, yuck!

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,976
What?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,895
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,275
You licked and you put.

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,568
Yeah, so?

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,531
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,742
You used my toothbrush?

12
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,247
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

13
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,583
Mine is the red one!

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,589
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

15
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,925
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,094
...but we can use the same soap?

17
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,140
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,726
The next time you shower...

19
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,855
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,406
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,535
Look at you fancy lads!

22
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,203
What's the occasion?

23
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,123
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

24
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,042
He's having a brunch.

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,753
Ready when you are.

26
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,549
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,843
You guys are getting tattoos?

28
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,388
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

29
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,432
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

30
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,977
I'm getting a lily.

31
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,522
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

32
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,901
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

33
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,780
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,031
What?

35
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,200
What's on your shoulder?

36
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,660
A chip.

37
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,291
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
A tattoo?

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,376
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

39
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,547
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

41
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,674
No. Sorry, I don't.

42
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,178
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

43
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,513
What if it doesn't come out right?

44
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,808
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,770
Why is everyone staring at me?

46
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,732
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

47
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,775
Richard's going to the party too?

48
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,361
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

49
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,865
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

50
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:24,203
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

51
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,331
No, I think you should tell them.

52
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,001
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

53
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,587
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

54
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,798
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

55
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,842
"God, I hope they get together. "

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,140
Shall we?

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,934
Okay, wait.

58
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,810
You know what?

59
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,147
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

60
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,817
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

61
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,655
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

62
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,408
We're here!

63
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,370
Hi, kids!
The children!

64
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,456
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,916
Happy birthday!

66
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,627
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

67
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,798
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,551
So you kids take the train in?

69
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,263
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

70
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,764
Speaking of whom...

71
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,893
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

72
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,774
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

73
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,360
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

74
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,448
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

75
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,784
Are we still on that?

76
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,496
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

77
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,581
She's probably not even pretty.

78
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,544
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

79
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,970
Can you believe this place?

80
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,055
I know. This is a great apartment.

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,183
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

82
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,770
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

83
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,606
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

84
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,233
Seriously.

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,485
Hey.

86
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,654
We were just saying, great apartment!

87
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,823
Thanks. You want it?

88
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,533
I'm moving to a bigger place.

89
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,493
You should take this one.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,912
Can you see me in a place like this?

91
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,583
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

92
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,835
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

93
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,048
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

94
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,299
On TV.

95
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,968
Stop talking. Okay!

96
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,722
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

97
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,807
I am not telling you guys anything.

98
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,852
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

99
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,730
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

100
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,608
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

101
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,318
Would you let it go?

102
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,988
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

103
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,491
You got your own little speedster.

104
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,161
- Seriously, it's not like that.
Tell you what.

105
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:15,374
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could...

106
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,001
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

107
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,045
What? I'm kidding!

108
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,131
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

109
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,099
Okay, Rach.

110
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,477
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

111
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,397
- Well, I...
- I like this lily.

112
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,066
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

113
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,777
She had a more open, giving spirit.

114
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,279
Foghorn Leghorn!

115
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,242
Blond girl?
You're in room two.

116
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,953
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

117
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,247
- Here we go!
- Uh-huh.

118
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,749
You're not going.

119
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh-huh.

120
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,211
Is this because of what Ross said?

121
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,671
No.

122
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,591
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

123
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,679
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

124
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,057
Come on, what is this, 1922?

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,017
What's 1922?

126
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,770
Just, you know, a long time ago.

127
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,817
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

128
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,696
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

129
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,534
Do you want this tattoo?

130
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,786
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross...

131
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,789
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

132
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,750
No.

133
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,586
Who is the boss of you?

134
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,297
You?

135
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,884
No. You are the boss of you!

136
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,053
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,055
Go!

138
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,396
How you doing?

139
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,231
I'm a twinkie!

140
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,568
Really? I'm a hero.

141
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,989
This is so hard.

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,284
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

143
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,245
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

144
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,123
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

145
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,417
My parents are dead.

146
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,754
God, you are so lucky!

147
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,508
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

148
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,427
Just hang in there, okay?

149
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,764
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

150
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,481
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

151
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,404
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

152
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,618
Honey.

153
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,413
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

154
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,123
I have no idea.

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,126
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

156
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,382
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

157
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,511
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

158
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,639
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

159
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,434
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

160
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,145
Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

161
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,814
So, Jack...

162
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,900
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

163
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,278
Of course not.

164
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,030
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

165
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,245
Oh, Jack, stop!

166
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,289
Come on!

167
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,417
It's my birthday!

168
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,839
Can we drop this?

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,300
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

170
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,721
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

171
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,014
You want it.

172
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,266
Why would I want another apartment?

173
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,685
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

174
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,062
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

175
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:13,778
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

176
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,489
- What?
- I'm sorry.

177
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,618
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

178
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,787
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

179
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,539
...that I don't need a roommate.

180
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:28,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't need a roommate either.

181
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,754
I can afford to live here by myself.

182
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,633
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

183
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,969
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

184
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,472
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

185
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,349
We're not Bert and Ernie.

186
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,560
You know what?

187
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,562
If this is the way you feel...

188
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,648
...then maybe you should take it.

189
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,692
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

190
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,902
Maybe I will!

191
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,403
- Fine with me!
- Great!

192
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,406
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

193
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,283
...the spoons!

194
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,411
Whose drink can I freshen?

195
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,956
Almost time for cake!

196
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,384
Mon?

197
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,302
Mon, are you okay?

198
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,556
- Remember that video of Mom and Dad?
- Yeah?

199
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,351
- Well, I just caught the live show.
- Ew!

200
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,407
- Hey there.
- What?

201
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,036
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

202
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,122
Really?

203
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,707
Richard?

204
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,753
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

205
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,465
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

206
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,929
That's an idea.

207
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,266
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

208
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,726
- Oh?
- Oh?

209
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,602
Oh...

210
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,606
She never tells us anything.

211
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,276
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

212
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,821
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

213
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,074
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

214
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,034
Is that crystal?

215
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,581
So who's the mystery man?

216
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,625
Well, he's a doctor.

217
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,294
A real doctor?

218
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,713
No, a doctor of meat.

219
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,424
Of course he's a real doctor.

220
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,301
And he's handsome.

221
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,971
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

222
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,182
Well, that's wonderful.

223
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,273
Mom, it's okay.

224
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,524
It is, Judy.

225
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,193
Jack!

226
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,781
Could you come in here for a moment?

227
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,324
Now!

228
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,786
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

229
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:16,044
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

230
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,881
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

231
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,383
I'm the twinkie.

232
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,178
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

233
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,431
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in...

234
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,351
Oh, please! A relationship?

235
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,019
Yes, a relationship!

236
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,480
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

237
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,815
Really?

238
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,525
Yes.

239
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,195
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

240
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,617
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

241
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,827
When did I say that?

242
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,622
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

243
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,000
Happy birthday to you

244
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,754
Happy birthday to you

245
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,342
Happy birthday, dear Jack

246
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:09,347
Happy birthday to you

247
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,893
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

248
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,230
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

249
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,315
Okay, let me see yours.

250
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,737
Let's see yours again.

251
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,283
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

252
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,537
Oh, no!

253
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,707
It's gone! That's so weird.

254
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,710
I don't know how, where it went.

255
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,171
You didn't get it?

256
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,464
No.

257
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,091
Why not?

258
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

259
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,554
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

260
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,349
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

261
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,227
And did you know
they do this with needles?

262
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,147
Really? You don't say?

263
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,275
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

264
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

265
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,156
I'm sorry about what...

266
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,824
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

267
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,121
Do we need to hug?

268
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,541
No, we're all right.

269
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,669
So I got you something.

270
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,297
Plastic spoons!

271
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,594
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

272
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,973
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

273
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,808
What?

274
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,647
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

275
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,192
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

276
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,361
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

277
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,571
I didn't think that was serious.

278
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,368
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

279
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,286
Well, it was a fight...

280
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,789
...based on serious stuff, remember?

281
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,166
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

282
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,378
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

283
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,963
...or whatever.

284
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,885
Well, there you go.

285
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,889
Hey, are you cool with this?

286
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,808
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

287
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,851
I've never been lower or wetter.

288
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,439
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

289
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,274
...bedroom into a game room.

290
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,777
Put the foosball table in there.

291
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,739
Why do you get to keep the table?

292
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,536
I did pay for half of it.

293
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,873
I paid for the other half.

294
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,835
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

295
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,129
All right, you're on.

296
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,549
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

297
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,262
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

298
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,018
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

299
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,396
Which sister?

300
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,152
So are you sorry that I told them?

301
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,448
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

302
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,953
Did you get it?

303
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,955
Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

304
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,623
Okay, really quick.

305
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,460
That's great!

306
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,919
Very tasteful.

307
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,464
- Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
Yes!

308
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,632
What? You didn't get one.

309
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,510
Okay. Well then, what is this?

310
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,473
What are we looking at?

311
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,184
That blue freckle?

312
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,103
That's my tattoo.

313
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,898
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

314
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,733
I got her in the chair...

315
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,862
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

316
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,739
Okay, hi!

317
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,369
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

318
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,999
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

319
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,754
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

320
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,508
Oh, what a load of crap!

321
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,260
That is a dot!

322
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:21,224
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

323
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,312
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

324
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,610
You got a tattoo?

325
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,987
Maybe.

326
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,158
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

327
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,912
Well, let me see.

328
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,625
Well?

329
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,377
Well, it's really...

330
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,505
...sexy.

331
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,216
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

332
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,176
...wow!

333
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,055
Really?

334
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,765
Yeah, so...

335
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,561
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

336
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,273
I guess.

337
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,400
Save us some pizza.

338
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,658
Get it out of the corner!

339
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,661
Pass it! Pass it!

340
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,080
Stop talking to your men!

341
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,541
Yes!

342
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,543
And the table is mine.

343
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,299
Congratulations.

344
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,355
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

345
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,274
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

346
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,693
We'll be over there all the time.

347
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,571
Except when we are here.

348
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,329
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

349
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,665
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

350
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,045
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines...

351
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,130
Is that my bra?

352
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,136
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

353
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,473
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

354
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,102
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

355
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,146
Yeah, I remember.

356
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,027
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

357
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,791
You want me to...

358
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,502
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

359
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,878
Nah...

360
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,006
You keep it.
You need the practice.

361
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,426
Thanks.

362
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,512
So...

363
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,597
...I guess this is it.

364
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,099
Yeah, right.

365
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,642
I guess so.

366
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,063
Listen...

367
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,607
When am I gonna see you?

368
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,985
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

369
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,612
Right. Yeah. Okay.

370
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,115
Take care.
