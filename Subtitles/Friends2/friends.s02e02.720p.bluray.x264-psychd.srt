1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:11,093
Okay, these were expensive,
and he's gonna grow out of them...

2
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,971
...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist!

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,973
Aww!

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,935
Look at these.

5
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,145
Hey, Ben.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,063
"Just do it"! Unh!

7
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,775
Oh, my God! Oh!

8
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,736
Was that too much pressure for him?

9
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,533
- Oh, is he hungry already? Aw.
- I guess so.

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,410
You know, it's...

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,458
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,377
Oh, uh, I gotta get one too.

13
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,965
Hey, what are you guys doing?

14
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,676
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,762
Ladle?

16
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,180
Will you guys grow up?

17
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,183
This is the most natural,
beautiful thing in the world.

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,394
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

19
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,943
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

20
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,655
If you have a problem, if you're
uncomfortable, just ask questions.

21
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,492
Carol's fine with it. Come on.

22
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,621
- Carol?
- Carol.

23
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,918
I was wondering if Joey could ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

24
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,923
- Sure.
- Uh...

25
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,342
Does it hurt?

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,096
It did at first, but not anymore.

27
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,555
Chandler?

28
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,435
So, uh, how often can you do it?

29
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,479
As much as he needs.

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,566
Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. Uh...

31
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,196
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

32
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,624
- Rachel, do you have muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

33
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,835
Oh, you're busy, I'll get it.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,587
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

35
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,963
No, I'm all set.

36
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,132
Oh, you're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,800
- Oh.
- There you go.

38
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,302
Thank you.

39
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,055
Ugh, what a bitch.

40
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,270
Listen, guys, I have a friend
at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,522
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,358
So anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

43
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,236
I can't. I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,993
- Okay. Um, I'll go with you.
Great.

45
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,372
Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,084
- And hello to the rest.
Hi.

47
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,546
What are you doing?

48
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,090
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,052
- It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
- Come on.

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,137
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

51
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,307
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

52
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,435
- But I...
- Monica, she will kill you.

53
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,773
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,948
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,451
Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal.
In fact...

56
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,747
It's a big deal to me. This is great.
I really appreciate this.

57
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,499
You're welcome.

58
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:31,228
Bijan for men?

59
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,690
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

60
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,109
- Did you hear about the new guy?
- Who?

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,613
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man. "

62
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,541
Hombre?

63
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,673
What's he doing in my section?

64
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,591
I guess he doesn't know.

65
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,385
Well, he's gonna.

66
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,555
I'll see you a little later, okay?

67
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,351
Hey, how you doing?

68
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,603
Morning.

69
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,814
Listen, uh, heh. I know you're new...

70
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,151
...but, uh, it's kind of
understood that everything...

71
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,821
...from young men's to
the escalator is, uh, my territory.

72
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,575
- Your territory, huh?
- Yeah.

73
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,661
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

74
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,330
Hombre?

75
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,665
Yeah, all right.

76
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,506
You were saying?

77
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,556
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

78
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,100
- What?
- We were shopping and we had lunch.

79
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,144
All right. What did I have?

80
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,439
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

81
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,900
Hi, guys. What's up?

82
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,986
I went shopping with Monica all day
and I had a salad.

83
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,574
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

84
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,825
Um...

85
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,411
We went shopping for, um...

86
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,038
For, um...

87
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,207
For fur.

88
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,837
- You went shopping for fur?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:25,300
And then I realized
that I'm against that and, um...

90
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,719
So then we bought some, um...

91
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,222
Um, boobs.

92
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,146
You bought boobs?

93
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,858
Bras!

94
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,819
We bought bras!

95
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,030
We bought bras.

96
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,620
Bijan for men?

97
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,580
Bijan for...

98
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,417
Hey, Annabel. Uh...

99
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,671
Listen, I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

100
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,257
Actually, I sort of have plans.

101
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,633
Oh.

102
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,097
You ready, Annabel?

103
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,850
You bet.

104
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,187
- Maybe some other time.
- Yeah.

105
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,701
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

106
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,411
Bijan for men?

107
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,496
Bijan for men!

108
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,958
Okay, and this is Funny Clown.

109
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,753
Funny Clown is only for after his naps,
not before or he won't sleep.

110
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,382
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

111
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,844
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,765
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

113
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,853
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

114
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,732
Oh, this is so cute.

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,525
Ah, I got that for him!

116
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,360
"My Mommies Love Me. "

117
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,407
That's clever.

118
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,243
Hello?

119
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,120
Oh, hi, Jul...

120
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,998
Hi, Jew!

121
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,335
Uh-huh.

122
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,213
Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.

123
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,382
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.

124
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,801
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

125
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,266
Yes. Um, yes, I did.

126
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,644
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

127
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,692
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

128
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,325
Ben, dinner!

129
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,661
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

130
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,456
You didn't microwave that, did you?
It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.

131
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,501
Duh, I think I know
how to heat breast milk. Heh.

132
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,462
Okay.

133
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,465
What did you just do?

134
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,425
I licked my arm, what?

135
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,928
It's breast milk!

136
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,346
So?

137
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,600
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

138
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,229
- What is the big deal?
No, no...

139
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,440
What did you just do?

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,904
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,325
- You won't even taste it?
- No.

142
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,703
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

143
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,206
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

144
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,881
- Hey.
- Hi.

145
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,384
- Where is everybody?
- Took Ben to the park.

146
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,928
- Where have you been?
- Just out.

147
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:01,391
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

148
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,145
- Hey, thanks for your jacket.
- Oh, no problem.

149
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,564
- You can borrow it, by the way.
- Heh.

150
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,234
- Oh, here are your keys, honey.
- Thank you.

151
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,487
- Mon?
- Mm-hmm?

152
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,491
If, uh, you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

153
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,080
You know what probably happened?

154
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,167
- Someone must have stolen my credit card.
- Ah.

155
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,337
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

156
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,799
Huh. That is an excellent,
excellent question.

157
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,676
That is excellent.

158
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,889
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

159
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,474
- Judy.
- Who?

160
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,143
- Julie. Jody?
- What?

161
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,523
- You were with Julie?
- Mm. Look.

162
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,318
When it started,
I was just trying to be nice to her...

163
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,363
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

164
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,741
And then one thing led to another...

165
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,786
...and before I knew it, we were...

166
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,330
...shopping.
- Aah.

167
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,336
Oh, my God.

168
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,714
Wait, we only did it once.

169
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,510
It didn't mean anything to me.

170
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,805
- Yeah, right. Sure.
- Really!

171
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,849
Rachel,
I was thinking of you the whole time.

172
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,107
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

173
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,985
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

174
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,696
That is not true!

175
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,323
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

176
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,120
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

177
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,332
Okay, Monica,
I just have to know one thing.

178
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,171
Did you go with her
to Bloomingdale's?

179
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,976
Okay. Okay.

180
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:13,231
Okay, I just really, um...
I just need to not be with you right now.

181
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,117
Hi, who's this?

182
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,454
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

183
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,832
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

184
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,918
Joanne, it's not as simple
as all that, okay?

185
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,840
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

186
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,179
- Hey!
Hi!

187
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,930
How did we do?

188
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,808
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

189
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,852
I... I did not freak out.

190
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,147
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

191
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,941
It's gross!

192
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,651
My breast milk is gross?

193
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,489
This should be fun.

194
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,367
No, Carol.
There's nothing wrong with it.

195
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,163
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

196
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,708
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

197
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,922
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

198
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,549
- Come on, just taste it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

199
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,551
That would be no.

200
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,512
- Come on.
- Try it.

201
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,306
- It's natural.
- It doesn't taste bad.

202
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,392
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like, uh...

203
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,686
- Like what?
- Cantaloupe juice.

204
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,396
Exactly.

205
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,988
You've tasted it.

206
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,199
You've tasted it.

207
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,659
Uh-huh.

208
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,245
Oh, you've tasted it.

209
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,375
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

210
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,634
Give me the bottle.

211
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,933
Get me the towel.

212
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,082
Howdy.

213
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,461
Give me a box ofjuice.

214
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,133
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

215
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,386
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

216
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,516
Or maybe this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

217
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,978
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

218
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,690
What do you care?

219
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,861
You're an actor. This is your day job.
Isn't supposed to mean anything.

220
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,572
I know, but I was the best.

221
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,909
You know? I liked being the best.

222
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,332
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

223
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,668
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

224
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,712
Say you do that.

225
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,966
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

226
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,595
And then where you gonna run?

227
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,805
- I guess you're right.
- Damn right I'm right.

228
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,516
Show this guy what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

229
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:40,188
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

230
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,982
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

231
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,820
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

232
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,699
I don't know what to say.

233
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,202
That works good
because I'm not listening.

234
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,788
I feel terrible. I really do.

235
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,207
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

236
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,626
Rachel!

237
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,921
Say that I'm friends with her.
We spend time together.

238
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,173
- Is that so terrible?
- Yes.

239
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,926
- It's that terrible?
- Yes, Monica! You don't get it.

240
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,803
It's bad enough she stole the guy...

241
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,555
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

242
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,057
But now...

243
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,935
...she's actually...

244
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,563
But now she's actually stealing you!

245
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,984
Me?

246
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,111
What are you talking about?

247
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,738
Nobody could steal me from you.

248
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,409
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

249
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,619
Honey.

250
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,080
I mean, you're my...

251
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,958
And we're...

252
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,338
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

253
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,805
You guys, um, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

254
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,516
But, um, I love you guys too!

255
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,649
Ugh, I really needed that.

256
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,528
Look, I know you're in a place
right now...

257
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,281
...where you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

258
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,325
But she didn't do anything wrong.

259
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,955
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

260
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,625
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

261
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,796
Will you give that a chance?

262
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,923
For me?

263
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,386
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

264
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,930
I'd do anything for you!

265
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,559
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

266
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,287
Morning.

267
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,875
Heh. I said, morning.

268
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,544
I heard you.

269
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,299
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

270
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,759
You boys ready?

271
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,599
Ready.

272
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,226
Yeah, I'm ready.

273
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,275
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

274
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,652
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

275
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,531
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

276
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,533
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

277
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,077
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

278
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,080
My God, what happened?

279
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,458
Eh, these new kids, they never last.

280
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,003
Sooner or later they all...

281
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,422
...stop lasting.

282
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,177
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

283
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,928
Sure.

284
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,985
- So.
- So.

285
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,241
I just thought the two of us
should hang out a bit.

286
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,203
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

287
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,623
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?

288
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,791
- I know.
- Mm.

289
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,295
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

290
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,632
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

291
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,135
Really? Me?

292
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,179
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

293
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,181
Ross is so crazy about you...

294
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,601
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

295
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,604
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

296
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,316
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

297
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,783
Well...

298
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,494
...you're not totally paranoid.

299
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,414
- Oy.
- Um.

300
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,627
Okay. Um...

301
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,422
- God. Um...
- Heh.

302
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:02,593
When you and, uh,
Ross first started going out...

303
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,222
...it was really hard for me, um...

304
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:12,436
...for many reasons of which I'm not
gonna bore you with now, but, um...

305
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:20,653
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

306
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:25,866
And, um, Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

307
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,369
...and God, I hate it when she's right.

308
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,290
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

309
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,168
Listen. Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

310
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,297
- Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
- Yeah?

311
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,966
- I'd love it too. Okay.
- Okay.

312
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,718
- Oh, shoot, I gotta go.
- Okay.

313
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,012
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

314
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,847
- Bye.
- Bye.

315
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,982
What a manipulative bitch.

316
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,806
It's not bad.
