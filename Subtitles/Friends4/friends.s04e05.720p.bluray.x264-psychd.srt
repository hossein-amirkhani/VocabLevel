Thank you, my babies.

354
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,539
- Rachel?
RACHEL: Yeah?

355
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:36,127
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

356
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,546
- No.
- We kissed.

357
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,550
I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

358
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,468
I've been feeling guilty.

359
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,889
Okay

360
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,850
So, um...

361
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,727
...are we cool?

362
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,898
Okay.

363
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,068
I knew you would understand.
