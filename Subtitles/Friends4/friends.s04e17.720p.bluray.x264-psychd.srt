Did you tell her?

- I did.
- And what did she say?

187
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,072
"Thank you."

188
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,660
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?

Good one.

205
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,175
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.

206
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,803
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.

Now, you go home

it is definitely over.

you know, to see what's going on...

from the phone booth.

339
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,714
You can't hear me.

340
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,635
I wish I could know
if you'd heard any of that.

341
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,222
I suppose I've either told you that I love you
or given my neighbors a good laugh.

342
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,726
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. This is none of your business.

343
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,438
Suppose there's not much chance
you did hear that.

344
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,815
And there's the call waiting...

345
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,194
...so I should go.

346
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,696
Oh, well.

347
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,367
Hello?

348
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,327
ROSS:
Hi.

349
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,957
Ross, I love you.

350
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh.

351
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,295
Thank you.

352
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,430
- Hey.
JOEY: Hey.

353
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,184
I was just at the bank and there
was this really hot teller.

354
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,438
And she didn't ask me
to go do it with her in the vault.

355
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,066
Same kind of thing happened to me.

356
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,110
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

357
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,821
...gives me the pizza,
takes the money and leaves.

358
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,324
What, no "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

359
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,451
No, nothing.

360
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,455
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

361
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,958
I think you're right.

362
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,169
All right, ready?

363
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,671
- One.
- Two.

364
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,256
- Three.
- Three.

365
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,845
That's kind of nice.

366
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,307
- Yeah, that's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

367
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,065
- You want to see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,486
Free porn! We have free porn!
