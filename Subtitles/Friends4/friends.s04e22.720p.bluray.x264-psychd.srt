00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,717
That was the 10th time I've peed
since I've been here.

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,970
It's also, like, the 10th time
you've told us. Ha, ha.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,514
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry,
it must be hard to hear.

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,766
I'll tell you, it's easier
having babies playing...

00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,311
..."Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk"
on your bladder.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,982
I am so sick of being pregnant.

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,276
The only happiness I get
is from a cup of coffee...

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,571
...which of course is decaf
because, oh, I'm pregnant. Heh.

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,783
Pheebs, you want a cookie?

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,996
Thank you so much.

11
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:44,460
So, uh, Pheebs, honey,
how are those mood swings coming?

12
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,212
I haven't really had any yet.

13
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,934
- Hey, guys.
BOTH: Hey.

14
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,978
All right. Here's the ring.

15
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,232
Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.

16
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,111
So, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party?

17
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,406
Before you start handing out rings
and planning bachelor parties...

19
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,409
...don't you have to decide
who your best man's gonna be?

20
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,371
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward,
it's awkward.

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,457
I sort of already asked Chandler.

22
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,002
What? He got to do it
at your first wedding.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,422
Joey, I figured you'd understand.
I've known him a lot longer.

24
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,635
Come on, Ross. I don't have any brothers.
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

25
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,595
You can be the best man
when I get married.

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,558
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

27
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,102
Wait, wait.

28
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,356
So you get to be my best man twice,
and I don't get to be yours at all?

29
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,444
Oh, no. Yeah, of course,
you can be my best man.

30
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,867
What about me? You just said I could.

31
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,702
I'm not even getting married!

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,038
Okay, this is a question
for science-fiction writers.

33
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,040
I can't believe you're not picking me.

34
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,793
- Hey, how could it not be me?
- I'm not even...

35
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,087
- I'm not even...
- All right, you know what? That's it.

36
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,174
From now on,
Joey I want you to be my best man.

37
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,844
Yes. Shame about you, though.

38

- Stop it.
- What?

39
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,811
One of the babies is kicking.

40
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,564
- I thought that was a good thing.
- It's not kicking me.

41
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,191
It's kicking one of the other babies.

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,570
Oh. Don't make me come in there!

a big bowl I can borrow?

Yeah, there's one
right under the cabinet.

- Are you bachelors?

- No.
- Are you strippers?

- No.
- Then you're not invited.

to the party that we're gonna have either.

like something I want to do. Later.

for the party so far liquor-wise.

of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

the last one.

about no strippers.

everything's cool.

and the ring is gone!

Hi, Phoebe.

Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know,
seemed a tad edgy yesterday...

...at my shower.

about me not going to Ross' wedding.

- It just might be too hard...

when I was, um, living on the street.

if I slept with him.

that was an actual problem.

I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

You know, one of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

203
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,287
Yeah, and another one had never been
to a party before, so...

- Man, that is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

206
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,882
Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one
of those babies up for myself.

Where might one get one of those?

208
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,097
That ring, when my grandmother
first came to this country...

209
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,560
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

210
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,108
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

211
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,196
Oh, absolutely.
It's been in my family for generations.

212
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,366
And every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

213
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:09,245
So you might say it's a magic ring.

They wouldn't give me
her name or number.

They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

you tell them I'm missing a ring."

331
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,481
He's doing just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

332
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,107
- Oh.
- Great.

333
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,027
Oh, hey, listen, Ross,
thanks for being so cool about this.

334
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,279
- No, that's all right.
- No, it's not.

335
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:43,783
I mean, you made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

336
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,285
- Hey, come on. It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

337
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,746
You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?

338
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,624
You know what?
Ross, you were right from the start.

339
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,918
- He should be your best man.
- No, you should.

340
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,045
- Look, don't argue with me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

341
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,047
I get to choose my best man.

342
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,592
I want both you guys.

343
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,887
BOTH:
Really?

344
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,724
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

345
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,393
I mean, you two are my...

346
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,356
I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...

347
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,068
Well, thanks, man.

348
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,281
[SOBBING]
I got to go check something, okay?

349
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,871
- What a baby.
- Total wuss.
