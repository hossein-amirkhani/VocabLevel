Oh, yeah.

334
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,772
So I made snacks.

335
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,232
Please, just hang out, okay?

336
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,611
I'm just gonna rest my eyes
for just a little bit.

337
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,739
Mon, do you want us to come back later?

338
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,951
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.
Just keep talking.

339
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,121
I'm always the hostess.

340
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,708
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

341
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,127
- So?
- Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.

342
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,172
- Oh, good.
- She is now.

343
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,846
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

344
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,723
You think you know a person...

345
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,226
...then they turn around
and they sleep with Nick.

346
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,729
Nick and his rock-hard pecs
and his giant man-nipples.

347
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,693
I hate him. And I hate her.

348
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,697
Well, I don't hate her. I love her.
This is all my fault, really.

349
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,200
- Oh.
- How? How is it your fault?

350
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,245
Because, ugh, I should have called.

351
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,831
You know, if I'd just called her, she never
would have gone out with Nick...

352
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,501
...and they wouldn't have ended up
in bed together.

353
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,878
I threw her at his man-nipples.

354
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,966
Honey, this is not your fault.

355
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,762
Just because you guys had a fight
does not justify her sleeping with someone.

356
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,517
Well, if she thought
they were on a break...

357
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,195
Rachel, one of your customers seems
to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.

358
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,698
- Really?
- Will you call him?

359
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,909
Yes, I will. Absolutely.

360
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,038
Oh.

361
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,591
Hello, Rachel.

362
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,593
Hi, Joshua.

363
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,221
I left my wallet here on purpose.

364
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,639
Really?

365
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,142
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.

366
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,394
Oh, I'm glad.

367
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,772
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.

368
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,399
Yes?

369
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,068
How you doing?

370
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,909
