00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,586
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,755
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,675
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,011
Fifteen?

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,179
Your personal best! Ha, ha.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,015
Mm-mm. Mm.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,436
Where were you?

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,770
On a date.

9
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,440
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,568
PHOEBE: Which museum?
CHANDLER: How'd you meet her?

11
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,862
No. Answer his.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,948
We were at the back of the train.

13
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:36,535
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,748
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

15
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,251
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

16
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,046
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

17
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,632
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,261
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,806
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

20
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,726
Done! I did it.

21
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,437
Who's stupid now?

22
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,449
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

23
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,660
Um, that paper is two weeks old.

24
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,331
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,628
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,965
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,384
I hate being alone
this time of year.

Next it's Valentine's Day...

00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,888
...then my birthday, then bang!

30
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,891
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

I want somebody!

00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,317
You know, I want a man!

33
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,368
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

34
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,746
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,001
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

Yeah.

I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

40

I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,566
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

I was making headway.

Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

50
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,344
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

51
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,143
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

52

What's the matter?

53
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,444
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,824
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

Yell at them. Or fire them!

I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

You know what you can do?

63
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,021
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

64
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,234
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

65
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,195
Then they would all know who was boss.

66
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,533
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

67
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,204
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

68
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,123
Good enough to get fired.

00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,917

a big relationship.

Well, you know, possibly.

And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

191

Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

with a mango relish...

Why is nobody writing these?

We can remember them.

195
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,195

and make me cook them?
