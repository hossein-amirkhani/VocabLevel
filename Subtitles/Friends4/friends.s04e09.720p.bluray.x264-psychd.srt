you're unhappy.

333
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,194
That would make me unhappy.

334
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,406
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

335
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
Thank you.

336
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,081
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

337
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,093
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

338
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,971
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

339
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,639
Heard what?

340
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,976
Joanna passed away last night.

341
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,812
Oh, my God. How?

342
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,899
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

343
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,943
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

344
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,363
- I know.
- Oh, God.

345
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:04,619
Oh, God.

346
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,997
I didn't realize that you were so close.

347
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,751
Yes. So close.

348
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,508
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

349
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:23,512
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

350
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,641
...before it happened?

351
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,143
No, nothing.

352
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,940
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later...

353
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:39,070
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

354
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,656
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

355
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,533
I'm sorry. I have to go.

357
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,995
Good morning.

358
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,123
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

359
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,792
I sure did.

360
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,842
I'm so excited about having Monica
come onboard with us.

361
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,846
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

362
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,766
It is like losing a member of the family.

363
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,104
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

364
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,358
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

365
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,570
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

366
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:27,410
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

367
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,496
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

368
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,999
So without much further ado...

369
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,295
...I present to you our new head chef.

370
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,222
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

371
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,726
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

372
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,853
...we can have the recipe...

373
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,567
Are you going to kill me?
