Hi, uh, you don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

347
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,856
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

348
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,400
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

349
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,570
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

350
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,825
So, uh, would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

351
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,120
No?
