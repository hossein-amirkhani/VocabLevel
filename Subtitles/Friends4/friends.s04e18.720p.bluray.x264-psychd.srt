Okay. Okay.

336
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,583
All right.

337
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:15,463
Help. Am I a Mark or a John?

338
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,300
Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.

339
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,261
But you might make a good Barney.

340
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,264
All right, look, I am serious.

341
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,892
Tomorrow at 3:30,
I'm going to the courthouse.

342
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,727
You're actually going through with this?

343
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,647
Hey, look, this name has been
holding me back my entire life.

344
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,651
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me
and why I never do well with women.

345
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,571
So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be
Mark Johnson or John Markson.

346
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,201
You've got problems because of you,
not your name.

347
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,040
This has got to stop.
Chandler is a great name.

348
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,875
In fact...

349
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,461
Yes.

350
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,839
I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me
to name the baby Joey.

351
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:03,261
But... So I'm gonna name
the baby Chandler.

352
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,265
Really?

353
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,475
Yeah, but you have to
keep the name too.

354
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,019
- Okay, thanks.
PHOEBE: Okay.

355
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,146
- You want to hug it out?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,566
- Yay, yay. Oh, yay!
CHANDLER: Yay.

357
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,819
Okay, I'm gonna go tell
Frank and Alice right now.

358
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,195
Okay.

359
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,490
- Bye, Pheebs.
- Okay, bye.

360
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,493
- Ha, ha.
- Oh.

361
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:42,008
MAN [ON PA]:
Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.

362
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,139
- Nice luggage.
- I was going to say.

363
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,559
- Hey.
- Hi.

364
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,646
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you too.

365
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,523
Thanks for everything, I had a great time.

366
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,650
Oh, so did I.

367
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,070
No tongue.
