..."I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

348
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,909
You think? That's so nice.

349
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, come here.

350
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,835
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

351
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,128
ROSS:
Good night.

352
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,714
RACHEL: You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

353
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,342
Uh-huh.

354
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,181
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

355
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,683
...in that reckless,
haphazard manner?

356
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,314
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

357
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,233
Whenever.

358
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,655
She is a kook.

360
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,465
MONICA [THINKING]: If it bothers you
that much, just go out and get the shoes.

361
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,636
No, don't do this!

362
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,304
This is stupid!

363
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,641
I don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.

364
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,185
But then everyone will know.

365
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,982
Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.

366
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,943
I need help!
