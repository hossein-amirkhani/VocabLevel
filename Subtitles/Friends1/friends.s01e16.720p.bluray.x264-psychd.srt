00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,332
Okay, Pheebs, can I ask?

343
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,835
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

344
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,420
Um, yeah.

345
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,342
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

346
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,428
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

347
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,641
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson Thermos...

348
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,893
...so she threw it under the bus.

349
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,604
And then there's Randy Brown...

350
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,272
...who was like...

351
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,651
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was like your best friend?

352
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,861
- No.
- No.

353
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,907
Well, but that's what he was for me.

354
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,618
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away...

355
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,704
...and then broke his heart.

356
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,166
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

357
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,671
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

358
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,174
Oh, Pheebs.

359
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,762
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my Thermos...

360
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,265
...or anything, but...

361
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,268
- You won't lose him.
- You gotta talk to Joey.

362
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,811
Yeah, okay.

363
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,147
Come on. He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt...

364
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,983
He's falling in love with her.

365
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,193
Oh, please.
They've been going out a week.

366
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,739
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

367
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,244
Okay.

368
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,706
Oh. Okay. Oh.

369
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,973
Oh.

370
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,727
Yeah, um, may we help you?

371
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,786
Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing.
Would you come inside?

372
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,830
No, no, no.

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,750
You wanted me to take them down...

374
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,544
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

375
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,421

376
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,257
Rachel!

377
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,551
I'm okay. I'm okay.

378
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,928
Mr. Heckles?

379
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,599
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

380
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,978
See, this is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
