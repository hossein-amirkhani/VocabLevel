You see, most people,
when their pets pass on...

...emotionally stunted...

344
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:16,797
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

345
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,384
...which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

346
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,307
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me. Define me.

347
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,310
Love me. I need love."

348
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,438
So you talked to your dad, huh?

349
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,691
Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

350
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,527
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know even though she does.

351
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,530
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore...

352
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,824
...because he got
a restraining order.

353
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,079
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

354
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,288
Wow.

355
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,083
Things sure have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

356
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,419
So, Joey, are you okay?

357
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,171
Yeah, I guess.

358
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,674
It's just...
You know, they're parents.

359
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,885
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

360
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,762
Even if you know better...

361
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,473
...you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

362
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,724
And just think...

363
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,060
...in a couple years,
we get to turn into them.

364
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,687
Oh, please.

365
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,523
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond...

366
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,776
...chasing after 20-year-old boys...

367
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,820
...or I'll end up like my mom.

368
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,867
- Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

369

MONICA:
How's it going?

370
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,039
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

371
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,791
ALL:
Oh.

372
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,126
Yeah, right.

373
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,920
ALL:
No, no, really. Aw.

374
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,925
- What happened?
- Ugh. I don't know. I mean...

375
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,635
He's a good person...

376
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,762
...and he can be really sweet.

377
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,266
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

378
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,935
It's just, I hate that guy.

379
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,112
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

380
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,990
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

381
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,034
Next stop, Rachel Green.

383
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,751
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

384
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,545
Sorry, wrong boobies.

385
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,893
Hello, Joey.

386
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,645
Hello, dear.
