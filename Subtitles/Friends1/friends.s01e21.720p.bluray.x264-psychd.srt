1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,045
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:07,673
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:11,593
Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,513
Still, it's just such reckless spending.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,598
When somebody steals your credit card...

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,810
...they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:28,068
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,155
That's me.

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,117
Oh! Oh, the yuck.

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,786
He's doing it again!

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,247
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

12
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,791
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

13
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,126
Come here, Marcel!

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,503
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

15
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,673
You've got to do something
about the humping.

16
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,092
What? It's just a phase.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,095
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,684
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,228
RACHEL:
Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,688
- What?
RACHEL: Ugh!

21
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,650
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

22
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,705
Ugh, Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,708
- This woman's living my life.
- What?

24
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,838
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

25
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,257
Look at this. Look.

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,093
She buys tickets to plays I want to see.

27
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,596
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

28
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,349
She spent $300 on art supplies.

29
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,892
You're not an artist.

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,062
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

31
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,192
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

32
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,112
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,447
Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?

34
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,118
Oh, it's so late for "shall we?"

35
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,121
Do I go horseback riding
in the park, hmm?

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,331
Do I take classes at The New School?

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,500
- No.
- No.

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,377
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,964
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,558
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,937
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
I should have a name that's more neutral.

42
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,939
Joey Switzerland?

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,199
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm...

44
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,617
...this big.

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,993
Which I'm not!

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,874
Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?

47
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,294
Stalin.

48
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,714
Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

49
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,426
- Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
- Huh.

50
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,804
Joe Stalin.

51
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,850
You know, that's pretty good.

52
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,561
- You might want to try Joseph.
- Ah!

53
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,528
Joseph Stalin!

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,323
- I think you'd remember that!
- Oh, yes!

55
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,702
Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,581
Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.

57
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,091
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,592
Hi.

59
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,846
Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.

60
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:29,351
Um, I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

61
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,146
What are you doing?

62
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,648
All right, great.

63
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,817
Great. Thanks a lot.

64
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,819
I'm going to tap class.

65
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,239
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

66
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,825
She's got my life.
I want to see who she is.

67
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,369
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,248
Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,251
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

70
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,253
This is madness, I tell you.

71
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,547
For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!

72
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,136
Thank you.

73
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,103
What do you think?

74
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,272
Lots of things.

75
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,108
Which one do you think she is?

76
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,943
- May I help you?
- Oh, no, thanks.

77
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,862
We're just here to observe.

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,907
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

79
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,409
Spare shoes are over there.

80
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,039
What does she mean?

81
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,082
I think she means, "You dance...

82
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,917
...a dance class!"

83
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Come on, come on, come on!

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,671
RACHEL:
Really?

85
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,799
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

86
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:47,596
People, last time there were yogurt containers
lying around after class.

87
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,598
Let's not have that happen again!

88
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,142
She could be you.

89
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,065
Let's get started.

90
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,694
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

91
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,242
Okay, I'm not getting this!

92
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,537
I'm totally getting it!

93
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,420
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

94
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,430
What? You just click when they click.

95
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,810
All right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

96
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh! Oh.

97
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:41,608
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

98
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,736
Great, it's gym class all over again.

99
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,405
RACHEL & PHOEBE:
Aww.

100
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,784
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

101
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,996
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

102
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,965
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

103
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,383
Okay, here I am.

104
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,052
So who's the new tense girl?

105
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,762
She's your partner.

106
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,681
- Hi, I'm Monica.
- Hi.

107
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,392
Oh, ha.

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,686
Monica.

109
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,855
Hi, I'm Mon...

110
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,064
Nana.

111
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,567
- Monana?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,610
It's Dutch.

113
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,363
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

114
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,157
[SPEAKING IN DUTCH]

115
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,162
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.

116
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,622
And we're dancing!

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,542
Five, six, seven, eight.

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,925
Hi.

119
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,345
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,765
- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,603
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

122
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,650
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

123
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,070
Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

124
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,157
Hey, he beat you!

125
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,916
She says, as time goes on,
he'll start getting aggressive and violent.

126
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,584
What does this mean?

127
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,421
I have to give him up.

128
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,650
I can't believe it. This sucks!

129
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,320
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

130
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,782
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing...

131
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,451
...and before you know it,
he's this little thing...

132
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,246
...I can't get off my leg.

133
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,457
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

134
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,667
No. No.

135
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,671
The vet said that unless he's in a place
where he has regular access...

136
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,092
...to some monkey loving...

137
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,136
...he's just gonna get vicious.

138
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,181
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,852
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

140
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,277
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

141
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:36,241
We're applying to a lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

142
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,035
You know, like, uh, San Diego.

143
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,371
Right?

144
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,875
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

145
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,507
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

146
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,177
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

147
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,017
- Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.

148
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,977
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

149
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,770
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

150
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,522
Nope. We took her to lunch.

151
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,400
Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.

152
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,738
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

153
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,490
She stole! She's a stealer!

154
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,369
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

155
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,874
I mean, she's this astounding person...

156
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,251
...with this amazing spirit!

157
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,546
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

158
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,217
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

159
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,677
Mm-hm.

160
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,681
I love that joke.

161
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,190
- No way! No way did you do this!
- Monana was very brave.

162
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,941
It was so wild.

163
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,070
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615...

164
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:59,115
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

165
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,786
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts...

166
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,998
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

167
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,167
Go, Monana!

168
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,964
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

169
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:20,011
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

170
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,348
Oh, by the way...

171
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,810
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

172
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,312
Excuse me?

173
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,189
There's an open call for Cats.

I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"...

...and make complete fools of ourselves.
What do you say?

No, no, no.

Remember who
you're dealing with here. Ha.

178
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:46,663
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

179
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,832
That's because of
your Amish background.

- What?
- Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

181
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,171
Right.

00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,842
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

I was just like you.

00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,224
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,310
- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
- Uh-huh.

186
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,148
I thought that movie was so incredibly...

187
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,357
...boring!

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,068
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid...

189
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,821
...kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

190
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,990
What was that?

191
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:26,786
It's like, "Kid, wait a year.
Leave home, do some community theater!"

192
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,790
I walked out of there, and I thought:

193
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,378
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

194
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,257
And that scared me more than
all the other crap I was afraid to do.

195
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,092
Wow.

196
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,470

not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.
