Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

338
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,926
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

339
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,433
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

340
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,602
The bigger half.

341
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,148
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

342
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,776
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
ALL: Mm.

343
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,904
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

344
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,866
...but for me this has been really great,
you know?

345
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,786
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

346
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,788
...or projectile vomiting.

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,793
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

348
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,880
...or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

349
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,590
...syphilis and stuff...

350
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,137
...we wouldn't be all together, you know?

351
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,972
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

352
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,020
...is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

353
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,480
RACHEL & JOEY:
That's so sweet.

354
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,649
RACHEL:
Thank you.

355
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,318
ROSS:
Mm.

356
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,611
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

357
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,071
And a crappy New Year.

358
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,532
ALL:
Hear, hear.
