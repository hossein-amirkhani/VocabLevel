grow up and start being a mom?"

334
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,764
- Wow.
- Wait, then she came back with:

335
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:29,477
"The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

336
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,105
Okay, wait. Are you sure she didn't say:

337
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:37,109
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?"

338
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,823
- That makes more sense.
- You think?

339
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,533
Yeah.

340
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,786
So, what's going on now?

341
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,997
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

342
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,335
I don't hear anything. Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,711
What do you see?

344
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,297
It's hard to tell.
They're so tiny and upside down.

345
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,799
Wait, wait, wait.

346
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,386
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

347
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,973
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

348
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,810
You okay, kiddo?

349
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,230
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right. You be good.

350
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,148
Drive safe.

351
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,692
[CHUCKLES]

352
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,778
- Mrs. Bing.
- Mr. Geller.

353
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,201
Hey.

354
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,621
You mean that?

355
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,457
Yeah, why not?

356
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,877
- So I told her.
- Oh.

357
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,588
- How did it go?
- Awful. Awful.

358
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,674
Couldn't have gone worse.

359
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,261
- Well, how do you feel?
- Pretty good.

360
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,848
I told her.

361
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,017
Well, see?

362
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,354
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

363
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,024
But we don't have to go down that road.

364
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,657
Now, this is just the first chapter...

365
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,954
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

366
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,834
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

367
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,961
What's a "niffle"?

368
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,131
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

369
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,510
All right, all right,
so I'm not a great typist.

370
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,723
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

371
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,810
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

372
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,105
- All right, that's it. Give them back.
GROUP: No.
