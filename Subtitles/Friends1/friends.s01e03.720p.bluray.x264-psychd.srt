- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,495
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

You know I'm gonna be doing that
at parties, right?

- What?

Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

181
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,002
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,756
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

183
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,426
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

Yep. We sure showed

- Nice.

Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes...

- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

191

Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

192
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,376
- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

- Hey, Weird Girl.

- Did you pick out the vowels?

Yes, but I left in the Y's.

Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,831
I just can't stand your friends.

340
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,383
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

341
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,178
That was fun.

342
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,266
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

343
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,106
- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

344
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,943
So how'd it go?

345
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,947
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

346
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,955
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

347
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,838
ROSS:
You had a rough day, huh?

348
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,841
- Oh, you have no idea.
ROSS: Come here.

349
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,764
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
GROUP: No, no, no.

350
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,223
I don't care. I don't care.

351
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,560
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

352
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,355
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

353
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,024
Yeah, all right.
