Look, you'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

So, uh, how did it go with Celia?

347
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,848
Oh, uh, I was unbelievable.

348
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,976
All right, Ross.

349
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,187
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

350
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,856
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

351
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,527
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines...

352
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,320
...themes, a motif.

353
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,240
At one point, there were villagers.

354
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,660
Oh, and, uh...

355
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,123
Well, um, you know, by the time
we finished with all the dirty talk...

356
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,875
...it was kind of late
and we were both exhausted, so...

357
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,670
- You cuddled.
- Yeah, which was nice.

358
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,840
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie or something?

359
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,134
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
for Chandler?

360
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,678
Whoa. Where the hell is he?

361
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is...

362
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,475
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy.

363
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,854
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something.

364
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,608
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

365
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,113
Whoa.

366
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,084
- How's this?
- Eek!

367
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,462
- Sorry. How about over here?
- Oh!

368
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,589
See, now, that just means it's working.

369
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,924
- Does this hurt?
- No.

370
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,594
- How about this?
- Aah!
