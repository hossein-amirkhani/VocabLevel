00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,596
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

341
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,515
But...

342
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,943
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

343
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,778
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

344
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,823
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

345
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,783
There's no Rachel!

346
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,791
- Oh, hey. I got that.
- Oh.

347
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,502
- Thanks, sweetie.
- No problem.

348
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,760
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

349
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,513
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

350
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,515
No, they will. I just, uh...

351
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,017
- Can't wait. Heh.
- Can't wait.

352
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,768
Come on, they're gonna love you.
