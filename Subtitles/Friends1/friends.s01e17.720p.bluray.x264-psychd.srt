Hey.

343
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,261
Urs.

344
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,763
What are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

345
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:02,974
Listen, um...

346
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,019
Don't say "listen." I know that
"listen." I've said that "listen."

347
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,313
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,358
I don't get it.
What happened?

349
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,027
What about everything
you said under the bridge?

350
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,322
Yeah, um, ahem...

351
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,742
You know, just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

352
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,163
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

353
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,874
You don't drink.

354
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,585
That's right, I don't.

355
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,087
But I was drunk on you.

356
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,049
- Oh, Urs.
- But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.

357
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,428
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

358
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,473
If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

359
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,685
No.

360
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,645
No, I couldn't do that.

361
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,107
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

362
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,278
So you know, it's either her or me.

363
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,866
Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.

364
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,080
You know...

365
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,625
...you're gonna be
really, really hard to get over.

366
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,501
I know.

367
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:23,137
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what...

368
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,389
...but you have never
looked so beautiful.

369
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,099
Really?

370
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,423
- Pheebs?
- Yeah.

371
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,394
He looks so tiny.

372
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,814
- We just got the message.
- Is he all right?

373
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,358
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.

374
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,319
He also found an M and an O.

375
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:25,074
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

376
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,875
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

377
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,337
So you feel like a dad yet?

378
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,339
No. Why?

379
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,343
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

380
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,053
That is very dad.

381
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,763
Oh, look, he's waking up.

382
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,558
ROSS:
Hey, fella. How you doing?
