00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,878
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,880
ROSS: Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,009
You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,428
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,179
As far as I'm concerned...

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,683
...there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,894
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,355
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,692
You know what blows my mind?

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,154
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,533
You just look down,
and there they are.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,286
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

13
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,291
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,917
...and then not even care.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,926
Multiple orgasms!

16
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,526
So Saturday night, the big night.

17

Saturday night. Saturday night!

- No plans, huh?
- Not a one.

19
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,328
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,831
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,460
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

22
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,297
- You just gotta do it.
- I know. But it's just so hard.

23
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,509
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,220
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

25
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,765
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,729
Why do you have to break up with her?

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,566
Be a man. Just stop calling.

28
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,112
If you want, I'll do it with you.

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,991
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

30
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,869
I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,537
You're breaking up with Tony?

32
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,456
I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,002
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

Does anybody want anything else?

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,635
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...

36
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,805
Nothing. I'm fine.

37
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,393
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,063
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,193
That guy, he burns me up.

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,779
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,949
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,577
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

43
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,956
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,168
Yeah, I got the extended disco
version with three choruses of:

45
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,253

- No.

51

Yeah. No.

Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

Oh.

You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,193
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,362
- Who?
- Me.

Why don't I just
join you both there?

Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,378
Yes.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,549
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

72

Um... But there's a rat problem.

73

Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,991
ROSS: You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

346
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,578
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

347
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,669
Whoa, I'm sorry.

348
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,421
Excuse me. We had this cart.

349
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,841
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

350
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,344
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

351
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,223
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

352
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,475
Hey, hey, hey.
There aren't any clothes in it!

353
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,311
Hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

354
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,940
Let go! Come on, this is my cart.
You know I saw it first.

355
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,401
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart...

356
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,153
...you're gonna have to
take me with it!

357
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,329
Yes! Did you see that?

358
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,789
You were incredible.

359
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,500
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,086
I could not have
done this without you.

361
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,677
ROSS:
Okay, um...

362
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,805
Uh... More clothes in the dryer?

363
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,184
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

364
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,190
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

365
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,484
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,949
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

367
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,744
MONICA:
Hi!

368
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,995
PHOEBE:
How'd it go?

369
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,246
Excellent!

370
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,751
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

371
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,337
What a beautiful story.

372
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,090
I'm fine, by the way.

373
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,675
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,095
- Where's Chandler?
- He needed some time to grieve.

375
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,598
CHANDLER:
I'm free! I'm free!

376
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,268
That ought to do it.

377
