00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,121
All right, look, in high school,
I was the prom queen...

340
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,666
...and I was the homecoming queen
and the class president and you...

341
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,751
...were also there.

342
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,420
Look, if you take this monkey...

343
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,673
...I will lose one of the most
important people in my life.

Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

No.

All right.

349
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,525
Well, then how about I call
your supervisor and I tell her...

350
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,570
...that you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart.

351
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,788
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,
won't it?

352
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,958
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

353
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,129
You know, with the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

Listen...

355
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,596
I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
You know, I just...

No, Ross, come on. No, no. It was my fault.
I almost lost your...

357
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,143
No, no. Yeah, but you were the one
who got him back.

358
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,811
You know, you were great.

359

Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.

360
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,447
Are you in the mood for, uh...

361
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,949
...something grape?

362
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,953
- Sure, that would be good.
- All right, uh...

363
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,084
Oh.

364
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,548

Well, ah, as long as we're here...

367
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,938
...and not on the subject, um, ahem...

368
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,607
I was thinking about, uh...

369
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,821
...how mad we got at each other before.

370
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,036
And, um, I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we...

371
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,455
- Rachel?
- Barry?

372
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,167
I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

- You see the von Trapp kids?
- No.

377
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,653
That's because I'm in front of them.

Well, high school
was not my favorite time.

I don't know. I loved high school,
you know?

381
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,498
It was just, like, four years
of parties and dating and sex and...
