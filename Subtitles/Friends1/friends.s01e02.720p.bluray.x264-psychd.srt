Everything you need to know
is in that first kiss.

- Absolutely.
- Yeah, I think, for us...

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,021
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,773
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through...

for the comedian again.

Bring back the comedian.

345
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,208
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

346
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,173
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

347
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,634
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

348
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,054
Then don't do that, all right?

349
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,474
Monica?

350
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,226
What do you think?

351
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,894
Mm-hm.

352
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,522
Are you welling up?

353
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,982
- No.
- You are.

354
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,443
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

355
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,779
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

356
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,407
Hi, Mindy.

357
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,701
Hi, it's Rachel.

358
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,705
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

359
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,582
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

360
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,501
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

361
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,380
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

362
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,759
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

363
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,096
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

364
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,683
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

365
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,983
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
