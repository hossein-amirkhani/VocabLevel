Oh, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

What?

339
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,891
The ball is dropping.

CLARK [ON TV]:
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

341
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,066
And the moment of joy is upon us.

342
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,486
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

343
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,281
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

344
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,825
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

One. Happy New Year!

347
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,836
You know, I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz...

348
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:41,674
...but I do believe there are three girls
and three guys right here.

349
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,053
Oh, I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

350
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,389
I can't kiss anyone.

351
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,349
So I'm kissing everyone?

352
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,269
No, no, no. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

353
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,064
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

354
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,607
All right. Somebody kiss me.

355
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,611
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

356
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,864
All right. All right. All right.

357
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,324
There.

358
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,375
I wanted this to work so much.

359
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,502
I'm still in there, you know?

360
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,922
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

361
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,009
But he's just phoning it in.

362
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,763
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much...

363
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,307
...doesn't love you back, you know?

364
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,810
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
