1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,383
The caterer sent me this Iist of 1 2
appetizers. I have to narrow it to si<i>x</i>.

2
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,716
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:18,227
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to pIay the wedding?

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,057
You're into swing music?

5
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:23,894
I used to go aII over town
Iistening to bands.

6
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:27,435
-ChandIer?
-Gap commerciaI.

7
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:32,901
-Did you book them? Did you caII?
-I wiII.

8
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:37,410
-You want me to caII?
-I'II do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:40,585
-What is your job?
-Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:45,623
This is impossibIe.
Why don't you just pick aII 1 5.

11
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,452
-There were onIy 1 2.
-Oh, yeah, I added three.

12
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,289
What are peanut-butter fingers?

13
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,132
The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress

14
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:42,473
WeII, heIIo.

15
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:44,478
She's cute.

16
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:46,844
ShouId we go try to taIk to her?

17
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:52,250
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
taIking to pretty girIs anymore.

18
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,516
CouId you guys heIp me?

19
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:59,728
Yeah, Iet me get that for you.

20
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:03,765
-It's reaIIy heavy.
-I got it.

21
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:11,601
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend ChandIer.

22
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,571
I'm Kristen.

23
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:18,215
Kristen, hi. Are you new to the area?

24
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:21,475
Because if you are, I'd Iove to show you
around sometime.

25
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:25,179
I actuaIIy just moved
from four bIocks over.

26
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,915
But this bIock is Iike another worId.

27
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:32,129
ActuaIIy, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:37,801
This street is the first in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,136
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:44,603
...wouId just fIow
right down the street.

31
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,506
Sometimes ankIe-deep.

32
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,205
Smooth.

33
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,748
E<i>x</i>cuse me?

34
00:02:56,455 --> 00:03:01,825
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,789
-I'd Iike that.
-Great.

36
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:05,257
Let me take this up.

37
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:08,763
-After you.
-Oh, no. After you.

38
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,300
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:23,577
Am I crazy, or does this totaIIy go?

40
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,253
Oh, my God! You Iook so beautifuI!

41
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:32,753
Thank you, RacheI.
But Iook at Monica!

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,922
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,426
I can't beIieve I found it.

44
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:44,294
Wow, you Iook so beautifuI.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:47,968
I'm Monica GeIIer. BaII Iike a baby.

46
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:49,572
I'm Megan BaiIey.

47
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,438
-Have you found your dress?
-These dresses are amazing...

48
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:57,273
-...but I couIdn't afford one.
-I can't either.

49
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:02,351
I'm here to figure out which one I want,
then I'II get it at KIeinman's.

50
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,782
They're having a huge saIe.

51
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,323
-Thanks for the tip.
-When are you getting married?

52
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:13,621
-I'm not. I just Iike to try these on.
-I do the same thing.

53
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,334
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married JuIy 25.

54
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,367
I'm just kidding too.

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,234
I'm getting married in December.

56
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,705
-When are you getting married?
-May 1 5.

57
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,540
It's getting cIose.
Who's your photographer?

58
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,546
-Jeffrey.
-We met with him.

59
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:38,847
-Did he show you nude wedding photos?
-The best man? Wow!

60
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:42,226
I know.
I aImost caIIed off my wedding.

61
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:46,021
-Who's your band?
-My fiancé wants The Swing Kings.

62
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:50,361
You're Iucky. My fiancé wants
the heavy metaI band, Carcass.

63
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,506
Is that speIIed with a C or a K?
It doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,334
Oh, don't buy that here.

65
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:03,173
Now that you know what you want,
go to KIeinman's.

66
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,542
This pIace is so overpriced.

67
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,684
I own this store.

68
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,846
So does this come
in another coIor, or...?

69
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,665
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,862
-Moving in.
-Can I give you a hand?

71
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:32,942
Okay, but be carefuI. Guy who was heIping
me had to Ieave because he hurt his back.

72
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,540
-Boyfriend?
-No.

73
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,442
I'm Joey.

74
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:39,174
Kristen.

75
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:42,251
What a beautifuI name.

76
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:45,181
What is it again?

77
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,888
Kristen.

78
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:52,058
-You Iive around here?
-Right down there.

79
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,128
Let me give you a IittIe tip.

80
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,132
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You couId wake up with your shoes gone.

81
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,638
I'II remember that.

82
00:06:01,907 --> 00:06:06,503
Listen, wouId you Iike
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:09,908
I have pIans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,709
Sounds great.
WeII, where does this go?

85
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,649
You Iook strong. Why don't I take that,
and you grab one of the bo<i>x</i>es.

86
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,791
Yeah, I'II get this one.

87
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,563
So this is BrookIyn?

88
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:39,869
Listen up. There's usuaIIy onIy
one dress in each size.

89
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:43,547
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

90
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,682
This is what you're Iooking for.
Memorize it.

91
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:53,990
When you Iocate the dress,
bIow on these, aII right?

92
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,326
Three sharp bIasts.
When you hear it, come running.

93
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:01,587
Here he comes!

94
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,065
-They're pushing!
-Don't be a baby!

95
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,761
-Out of the way!
-Let's go!

96
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:11,101
RacheI?! Come on!

97
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:23,948
No, not it. Not it. Not it.

98
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:28,751
Don't crowd me.

99
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,292
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!

100
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:36,659
I'm sorry, this one's taken!

101
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,634
-Megan!
-Monica!

102
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,499
-You came!
-Yeah!

103
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,470
-This is my dress!
-No!

104
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:49,646
-Yes it is. You saw me wearing it.
-And now you'II see me buying it.

105
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,042
You freak!

106
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,044
You wouIdn't even know
about this pIace without me.

107
00:07:55,286 --> 00:08:00,656
-Look, you don't want to fight me.
-Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

108
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:04,386
-I'm coming! I'm coming!
-Hey!

109
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:09,759
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!

110
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:20,272
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

111
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:21,910
Did you find the dress?

112
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,479
No. Get me out of here.
These shoppers are crazy.

113
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:28,174
-We've gotta get Monica.
-You gotta hoId my hand!

114
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,685
E<i>x</i>cuse me! E<i>x</i>cuse me!

115
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,917
Go! Go! Go!

116
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,005
So, Ross, how was your date
the other night?

117
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,237
Did you teII her about the magicaI
ride that starts with every fIush?

118
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:02,615
Laugh aII you want, but she said
she'd Iike to go out again.

119
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:06,183
In fact, I'II go caII her right now.

120
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:10,918
And I'II make sure and teII her my
friend ChandIer says....

121
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,526
Sorry I didn't stop by Iast night,
but I had a date.

122
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:23,969
When it's 1 :00 in the morning and you
don't come by, that's okay.

123
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:29,077
It was with this reaIIy hot girI
who just moved in right across the street.

124
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:32,077
-ReaIIy? Right across the street?
-Yeah.

125
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,615
-When did you meet her?
-Two days ago.

126
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,413
E<i>x</i>ceIIent!

127
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,983
You know, Ross met somebody too.

128
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,557
-Hey.
-How'd it go?

129
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,921
Great. We're going out again Saturday.

130
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,931
But I just found out she's
aIso seeing some other guy.

131
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,662
ReaIIy?

132
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:59,069
Joe, what wouId you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

133
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:03,577
I sort of am. I'm dating this girI
who's aIso seeing another guy.

134
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:05,942
But I'm not worried about it.

135
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:11,418
You shouIdn't be. I wouIdn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

136
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,921
I mean, that doofus is going to Iose.

137
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,829
So this is nice.

138
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:26,528
I wish I didn't have to go.
BeIieve me.

139
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:27,965
But I have to.

140
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:31,141
By the way, what's the name
of the girI you're dating?

141
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,934
-Kristen Leigh.
-Bye.

142
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:44,979
WeII, obviousIy onIy one of us
can keep dating her.

143
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:48,886
ObviousIy. So how do we decide?

144
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:52,585
WeII, now,
Iet's Iook at this objectiveIy.

145
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,128
I think I shouId date her.

146
00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:02,137
Or I'm the one who dates her.

147
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:06,967
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

148
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,903
Okay, but to go
in another direction--

149
00:11:10,148 --> 00:11:12,514
Okay. This can go on for a whiIe.

150
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,810
-We shouId order some food, then.
-No, Joey.

151
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:20,949
Look, why don't we
just Iet her decide, okay?

152
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,990
We'II each go out with her
one more time.

153
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:26,822
And we'II see who she Iikes best.

154
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:30,196
That sounds fair.

155
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:34,266
Maybe I'II take her
to that new French restaurant.

156
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,635
Wait a second. We have
to set a spending Iimit on the date.

157
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,969
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy pIace Iike that.

158
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:45,047
WeII, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

159
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:49,845
WeII, I guess I'II just have to do
what I do on dates.

160
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:58,985
-So Iet's decide on a spending Iimit.
-Yeah.

161
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,464
And a sIice...

162
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,839
...$6?

163
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:13,572
-I was thinking more Iike 1 00.
-Okay.

164
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:16,575
Can I borrow $94?

165
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,952
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

166
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,164
You're out of Diet Coke.

167
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:41,762
HeIIo?

168
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:45,973
What? You what?

169
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,007
You Iisten here, missy!

170
00:12:51,582 --> 00:12:55,518
That was Megan. She booked The Swing
Kings on the day of our wedding...

171
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,247
...and said I couIdn't have them back
unIess I gave her the dress!

172
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:02,516
Does that mean Carcass is avaiIabIe?

173
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:08,624
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is the dress!

174
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,701
ChandIer wants the band.
What do I do?

175
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:16,772
-Figure out a way to taIk him out of it.
-How?

176
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:19,135
You're out of toiIet paper!

177
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,621
I wanted to wish you good Iuck
on your date.

178
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,084
-Thanks.
-What time are you meeting?

179
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,453
We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.

180
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:41,029
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

181
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:46,028
-I am dressed.
-Oh, weII, good.

182
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,261
For me.

183
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,175
What's this?
Did you give yourseIf a faciaI?

184
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:55,971
I have an oiIy T-zone.

185
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:59,107
Okay, dude.

186
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,987
-You sent Kristen fIowers?
-That's right.

187
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,050
You spent $ 1 00.
That's the Iimit. You're screwed!

188
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:15,094
I sent the fIowers before
the actuaI date, so technicaIIy...

189
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,200
...I didn't break any ruIes.

190
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,437
Thanks for stopping by, though.

191
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:24,074
That's the way it's gonna be?
I can break the ruIes too.

192
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,800
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

193
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:30,070
-Why am I not surprised?
-Not gonna Iet you get away with this.

194
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,444
-I don't think you have much choice.
-We'II see!

195
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,350
Hey! So, just a Iight Iayer?

196
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:41,217
Yeah, just here and there.

197
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:51,465
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

198
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,669
Swing music is so out.

199
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:58,330
He's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

200
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,711
What are you guys taIking about?

201
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,404
We're taIking about The Swing Kings...

202
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:07,378
...and wondering whether they're
the right way to go.

203
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:11,054
I went to a wedding once
where they had swing music...

204
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:13,985
...and two months Iater,
the coupIe divorced.

205
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:17,559
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

206
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,162
...but they did teII me
that's why they got divorced.

207
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,529
But I Iove swing music!

208
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:26,396
But The Swing Kings?

209
00:15:26,671 --> 00:15:32,041
They suck so much that peopIe die at
their concerts. They just stop Iiving.

210
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:36,143
AII I know is that when Monica and I went
to see them, we had fun.

211
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,075
And there's another reason.

212
00:15:38,282 --> 00:15:42,582
-WeII, what is the other reason?
-I don't want to say.

213
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:46,382
WeII, you have to
because maybe it's stupid.

214
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:52,257
It's just, whiIe Monica and I
were dancing to them...

215
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,693
...it was the first time
I knew that...

216
00:15:56,267 --> 00:16:00,727
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance aII my dances with.

217
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,471
Oh, crap.

218
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:17,187
-Our tabIe wiII be ready in a few minutes.
-Oh, great.

219
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,618
-Is your back feeIing better?
-Yeah, that's fine.

220
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,623
I guess the more muscIes you have...

221
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:27,991
...the more they can
spasm out of controI.

222
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,199
-Kristen?
-Joey!

223
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:37,464
-What are you doing here?
-I Iike this pIace.

224
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:42,441
And technicaIIy, I'm not
breaking any ruIes, so....

225
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,913
WeII, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

226
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,779
-Hi.
-Hi. It's nice to meet you.

227
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:53,252
I used to have a friend named Joey.

228
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:56,791
I don't anymore.

229
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:01,221
Our tabIe wiII be ready
in a coupIe minutes.

230
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:05,528
Sure, I wouId Iove
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

231
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:12,306
So, Joey, you Iook famiIiar.

232
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:15,273
Are you on TV or something?

233
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,674
Joey doesn't Iike to taIk about it...

234
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,350
...but he's one of the stars
of <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

235
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:26,383
That's right. Don't you pIay a woman?

236
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,454
A woman in a man's body.

237
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,790
Much better.

238
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,994
It's funny, because you
Iook famiIiar to me too.

239
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,761
Have you ever been married?

240
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:44,531
Yes, I have.

241
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,039
In fact, just the other day...

242
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:51,408
...Kris and I were taIking about how
I've been married and how I have a son.

243
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:55,709
-LittIe Eric.
-That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

244
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:01,553
So you've just been married
the one time, then?

245
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:07,695
-WeII....
-You've been married twice?

246
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:11,664
Yes. And...

247
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,565
...another time after that.

248
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,599
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

249
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:22,937
Have you ever been so hungry
on a date...

250
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:27,617
...that when the girI goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?

251
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:33,353
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

252
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:40,329
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?

253
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:45,595
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a Iesbian?

254
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:50,335
-Do you two know each other?
-No.

255
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,374
Just seems Iike Ross is the kind of guy
who'd marry a woman...

256
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:58,105
...on the verge of being a Iesbian
and then push her over the edge.

257
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:05,648
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

258
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:12,055
Have you ever sIept
in the same bed with a monkey?

259
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,161
You Ieave MarceI out of this!

260
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,994
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own Ieather pants?

261
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,866
Have you ever Iocked yourseIf
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

262
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,305
Monkey-Iover!

263
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,518
Where do you think we Iost her?

264
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:39,514
ProbabIy around gonorrhea.

265
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,422
GeIIer, tabIe of two?

266
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,592
-You hungry?
-Does a bear shit in the woods?

267
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:01,274
-Hi, honey, I'm home!
-Don't come in here!

268
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:05,379
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

269
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,575
No. We onIy mess around at his pIace.

270
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,414
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so couId you come out here, pIease?

271
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,387
No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.

272
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:18,289
You got a wedding dress?

273
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:22,125
-Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
-Then why can't I see it?

274
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,230
Oh. I guess you can.

275
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:27,596
But I have to return it,
so you can't Iike it.

276
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:31,002
Okay, I promise. I'II hate it.

277
00:20:36,614 --> 00:20:40,914
Wow. You Iook hideous.

278
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:42,646
ReaIIy?

279
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:47,790
Yeah. That's Iike the most
ugIiest dress I've ever seen.

280
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:50,017
Why do you have to return it?

281
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,230
Because it doesn't reaIIy fit.

282
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,489
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.

283
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:58,634
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

284
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:01,532
But that dress is terribIe.

285
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:05,299
-It makes me want to rip it off you.
-Okay.

286
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:07,238
But you can't rip it.

287
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:09,275
WeII, maybe a IittIe.

288
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:21,548
Guys, you want to Iook
at the song Iist for the wedding?

289
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:23,186
Guys?

290
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:25,555
I thought you were gonna be gone aII day.

291
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:28,459
AII right, what's going on?

292
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,770
I'm sorry. I shouId probabIy
Ieave you girIs aIone.

293
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:46,609
Laugh aII you want, but in 1 0 minutes,
we'II have younger-Iooking skin.

294
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:52,253
You know, she couId use a IittIe....

295
00:21:53,257 --> 00:21:55,623
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!

296
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:01,086
