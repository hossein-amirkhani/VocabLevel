1
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:09,596
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

2
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,810
Probably Monica and Chandler.

3
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,578
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?

4
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:22,749
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

5
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:25,570
That'd be great. Thanks.

6
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:31,450
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

7
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:36,426
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?

8
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,177
What's up?!

9
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:44,347
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

10
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:46,929
What's up with you?

11
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:49,681
Why don't I tell you over here?

12
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:54,998
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

13
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,012
Poor Ray-Ray.

14
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,866
Oh, no. It's all good.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,002
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

16
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:07,214
I will not. I'm the divisional head
of men's sportswear.

17
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:11,067
Shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

18
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:13,790
- Oh, please.
- Are you?

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,456
No.

20
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,774
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

21
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:23,664
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
- You're having dinner with me.

22
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,098
Shut up.

23
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:29,544
I've gotta go.
This has been so great.

24
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:33,925
Oh, there you are.
You're a bad man for giving me these.

25
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,337
- So listen, just call me. Here's my card.
- Oh, wow, thanks.

26
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,960
- You're in real estate?
- No, that's an old card.

27
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,322
I got out of that to do something...

28
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,429
...where I could help people
and make a difference.

29
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,198
What do you do now?

30
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,501
I'm a party planner.

31
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:55,049
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

32
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:59,254
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.

33
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:03,333
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

34
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,426
She seems really, really fun!

35
00:02:07,268 --> 00:02:10,814
She's actually sweet,
and we used to be very close.

36
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:15,438
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you...?

37
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:18,226
Who you what? Who you what?

38
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:21,426
- Yes.
- Wow!

39
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:24,104
Wow, what? Who you what?

40
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:26,569
Oh, it's not a big deal.

41
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:27,960
They were lovers.

42
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,874
- What?
- What?

43
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,965
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

44
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:35,821
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

45
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:40,868
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

46
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,474
...kissing for a bit.

47
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,974
So that's two of my wives.

48
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:47,999
Where are you going?

49
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:51,029
To bring her back here!
Ross, get the sangria!

50
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,044
The One With Rachel's Big Kiss

51
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:35,591
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

52
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:40,498
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

53
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,691
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

54
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:48,891
...talking to the cute bartender.

55
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,697
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

56
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,106
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

57
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:01,242
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

58
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,372
Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

59
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,602
Certainly not a close one.

60
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:15,255
Hey, Rach.

61
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,605
Stop picturing it!

62
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,946
I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

63
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,977
They all look like they're having fun
don't they?

64
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:33,037
So where are my parents gonna be?

65
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,654
Well, if this is the wedding hall...

66
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:40,727
...then your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

67
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:45,036
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

68
00:04:45,257 --> 00:04:47,759
Why would they think they're invited?

69
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,505
You got me. I don't...

70
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:53,944
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

71
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:57,188
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.

72
00:04:57,434 --> 00:04:59,760
Ross' parents are coming.

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,450
Ross' parents are my parents.

74
00:05:04,114 --> 00:05:06,546
Well, see, parents are coming.

75
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,921
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

76
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:12,601
Well, this is just sad.

77
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:19,202
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

78
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,854
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

79
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,118
That is not a problem.

80
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:29,085
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Get out of here!

81
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:37,475
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

82
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:42,373
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

83
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,576
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.

84
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:50,421
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

85
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

86
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:58,002
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

87
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:03,082
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

88
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,848
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

89
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:10,947
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.

90
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:14,112
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling:

91
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:16,611
"Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous!"

92
00:06:18,186 --> 00:06:21,341
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

93
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,707
...and a little less E!

94
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:27,325
Okay. Who wore those?

95
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:32,304
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

96
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:34,807
This one is Paul O'Neill.

97
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,528
Who's that?

98
00:06:38,643 --> 00:06:42,427
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

99
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:45,978
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

100
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,380
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?

101
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:53,733
Are you serious?

102
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:54,983
007?

103
00:06:55,204 --> 00:07:00,519
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

104
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:02,432
It's a pretty cool tux.

105
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:06,575
It's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

106
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:11,447
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

107
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:15,448
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

108
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,591
Would Monica let me wear this?

109
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,305
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

110
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:30,169
I like our way.

111
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,020
Chess!

112
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:37,712
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,813
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

114
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,207
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

115
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:51,139
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

116
00:07:51,393 --> 00:07:53,195
And maybe a hat.

117
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,626
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.

118
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:58,028
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

119
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:03,184
You want to go to a movie tonight?

120
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,648
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

121
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,004
Can I come?

122
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,918
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

123
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:15,039
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

124
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,035
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

125
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,268
- Joey's.
- Okay.

126
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,504
I had this college friend...

127
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:27,712
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

128
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:31,435
...she and I, you know,
kissed a little bit.

129
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:34,805
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

130
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:39,055
- It did.
- Sure.

131
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:43,645
Hey. It happened.

132
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:49,771
It was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

133
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:52,377
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

134
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:54,987
And we ended up kissing.

135
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,552
For several minutes.

136
00:08:56,766 --> 00:09:00,586
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

137
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,374
Why are you taking this away from me?

138
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,405
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

139
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:11,820
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,032
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

141
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,792
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're so...

142
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:28,945
...vanilla.

143
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,168
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

144
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:38,683
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

145
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,215
To Ross.

146
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,485
If you don't believe me...

147
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:47,591
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

148
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:50,202
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

149
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,023
You should get inside my head.

150
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,851
Guess what I got for your wedding?

151
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,634
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

152
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:08,741
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

153
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:10,794
Batman's tux!

154
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,886
- What?
- That's right.

155
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:18,034
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

156
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,749
...that Batman film he was in.

157
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,669
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

158
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,508
- James Bond's tux!
- So?

159
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:29,477
So? If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

160
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,091
You need something
to make this day special?

161
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,807
Hello! You have
the most special thing of all.

162
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:38,422
You are marrying the woman you love.

163
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,694
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

164
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:49,905
"Pretty please?" Not very 007.

165
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:54,321
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

166
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:59,092
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

167
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:06,429
Okay, good, you're here.
All right, I figured it out.

168
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,349
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

169
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:11,854
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

170
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,096
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

171
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,284
Yeah. They're not coming.

172
00:11:19,516 --> 00:11:20,452
What?

173
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:24,377
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

174
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,019
They feel unwanted.

175
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:30,193
That's too bad.
It's true. But too bad.

176
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,837
If you could just call my mom.

177
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,932
Just let her know
you want them there.

178
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:39,516
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

179
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,738
No, she hasn't.

180
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,725
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

181
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,569
What am I gonna say?

182
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:50,411
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, blame it on the post office.

183
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,261
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

184
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:57,396
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

185
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:05,018
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani?
This is Monica Geller.

186
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:09,883
I'm just calling to say that we really
hope you can make it to the wedding.

187
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:14,101
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

188
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:17,753
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

189
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,609
Tell me about it!

190
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:26,905
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

191
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,967
What are they, Irish?

192
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:40,959
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

193
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:43,840
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

194
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:48,646
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

195
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:49,798
Oh, well.

196
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,917
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.

197
00:12:57,386 --> 00:13:00,055
- Were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

198
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:03,713
Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.

199
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:07,684
What one?

200
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:11,367
We were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

201
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:15,162
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

202
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:19,512
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

203
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,762
Anyway...

204
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:28,339
Speaking of drinking too much,
I told Phoebe...

205
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,185
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

206
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,096
What?

207
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:40,623
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.

208
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,139
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

209
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,634
...and we made out.

210
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:51,277
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

211
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,111
Really?

212
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,324
Ross is Batman.

213
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:08,045
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

214
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:12,563
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.

215
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,448
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

216
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:20,602
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

217
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,919
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

218
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,220
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.

219
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,897
We get ESPN, right?

220
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,942
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?

221
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,063
I don't like martinis.

222
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,264
- A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw?
- Yum.

223
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,491
I know the invitation says 6 p. M.

224
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:02,594
But does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

225
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,268
"The show"?

226
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:09,939
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

227
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:13,306
But weddings start
a little late, right?

228
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,237
Have you ever been
to one of my weddings?

229
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,722
Well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

230
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,225
...and I want my parents to see me.

231
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:27,368
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

232
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,186
The wedding starts at 6.

233
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,831
Okay. I totally hear you.

234
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,819
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

235
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:37,974
You'll "vamp"?

236
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:41,288
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

237
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:45,602
Because in Joey Tribbiani,
you get a minister and an entertainer.

238
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,517
I'm a "ministainer." All right?

239
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,455
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

240
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:57,638
Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.

241
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:00,765
Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.

242
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:04,492
And maybe he'd like to get married
at 007 o'clock.

243
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:09,431
All right. I will give you
10 extra minutes. That is it.

244
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,624
That's great! Thank you so much.

245
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,346
Well, we're in luck.
The tux fits perfectly.

246
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:22,654
Chandler, that jacket,
it's way too big.

247
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:26,578
Oh, that's okay.
The pants are way too small.

248
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:33,264
I'm sorry, sweetie.
You cannot wear that.

249
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,459
Now this means Ross is gonna be
the only cool one.

250
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:39,489
Something, by the way,
I never thought I would say.

251
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,287
Dude, take that thing off.
You look like a fool.

252
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,939
Come next door. I got some minister
headdresses I want you to see.

253
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,166
How can you not remember us kissing?

254
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:58,003
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

255
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:03,640
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

256
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,316
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

257
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:09,826
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

258
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:13,064
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

259
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,612
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

260
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,696
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

261
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,353
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

262
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,885
No!

263
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,324
- All right.
- Okay, fine.

264
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,982
You don't have to admit it
because I know that it happened.

265
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,517
Okay!

266
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:39,953
You have to admit it!
We kissed! Say it!

267
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:43,476
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

268
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:47,469
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

269
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:50,398
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

270
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:52,548
- But she didn't.
- I know.

271
00:17:57,672 --> 00:17:58,988
You carry that around?

272
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:03,409
Yes. I find it to be
something of a conversation piece.

273
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:07,552
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.

274
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,056
Why don't we put them on?

275
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,327
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

276
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,969
I would,
but my pants are a little tight.

277
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:21,187
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

278
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,504
Well, that stinks.

279
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:26,056
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

280
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,340
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

281
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,570
Let me try it on.

282
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:38,864
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

283
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,629
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

284
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:51,768
What's this?

285
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,794
An invitation to
the At First Sight premiere?

286
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:57,926
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in Batman.

287
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:03,075
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

288
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,160
Let me see that.

289
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:08,124
Oh, man.

290
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,340
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

291
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,307
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

292
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,544
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

293
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,972
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

294
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,301
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

295
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:32,926
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

296
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,686
They're so happy
to be a part of your special day.

297
00:19:37,664 --> 00:19:39,952
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

298
00:19:40,238 --> 00:19:45,445
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

299
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,546
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

300
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:55,299
...is for party time.

301
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:04,997
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

302
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,056
It was great meeting you.

303
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:11,302
And, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because...

304
00:20:11,551 --> 00:20:14,018
...you know, you've gotten weird.

305
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:17,151
Take care, you guys.

306
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,791
Wait a minute. Okay, look.

307
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,274
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

308
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,579
I won't let you take it away.

309
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,237
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this...

310
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:42,059
Oh, my God. You love me.

311
00:20:43,037 --> 00:20:43,974
What?

312
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:48,039
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.

313
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:52,942
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together...

314
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:59,279
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love...

315
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:06,626
Look who's being suddenly shy.

316
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:09,372
You have to feel what I feel.

317
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,466
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

318
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:15,977
I'm just a good kisser.

319
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,552
Shut up.

320
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,062
I'm sorry.

321
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,672
You don't have to be sorry.

322
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:30,943
I'm obviously kidding.

323
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:35,327
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

324
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:40,019
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

325
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:44,577
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

326
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,088
Anyway, I gotta go.

327
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,479
A kiss goodbye?

328
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,472
No? Okay.

329
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:06,113
I mean, I had no idea
that that would...

330
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:13,631
What the hell was that?

331
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:17,177
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

332
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,929
- And?
- I've had better.

333
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,490
I found one that fits.

334
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,254
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

335
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:38,293
Look at you, all handsome.

336
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,010
- Whose is it?
- Does it matter?

337
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,591
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

338
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,990
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

339
00:22:51,523 --> 00:22:54,441
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

340
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:57,120
Diane Keaton.
