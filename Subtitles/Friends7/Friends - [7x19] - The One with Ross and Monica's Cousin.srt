1
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:07,229
Oh, hey! How was your audition?

2
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:09,984
I'm sorry, do I know you?

3
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:12,797
What are you doing?

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:16,653
Practicing blowing you off.
I'm gonna be a big movie star!

5
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:17,775
You got it?

6
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:21,592
- Not yet, but the audition went great!
- What's it for?

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:25,455
A big-budget period movie
about three Italian brothers...

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,495
...who come to America at the
turn of the century. It's classy.

9
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:33,816
The director's supposed to be
the next-next Martin Scorsese.

10
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,904
The "next-next"?

11
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:40,943
A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
the next Martin Scorsese.

12
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:43,138
This guy's right after him.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,522
Hello?

14
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:53,498
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
the casting people. They loved you!

15
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:54,761
They loved me!

16
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,550
They want to see you again tomorrow.

17
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:00,779
- My God!
- There's just one thing.

18
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,807
Do you have a problem
with full-frontal nudity?

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,373
Are you kidding me? I never
rent a movie without it!

20
00:01:11,427 --> 00:01:12,364
Oh.

21
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,991
Okay, let me call you back.

22
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:20,889
- What's the matter?
- They want me naked in the movie.

23
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:22,308
- Wow!
- I know.

24
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:27,672
- My grandmother's gonna see this.
- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

25
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:33,647
The One With Ross
and Monica's Cousin

26
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,700
The wedding's so close.
Are you nervous?

27
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,803
Yeah, but I also can't
wait till it's over.

28
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:16,972
We have a pact not to have sex
again until the wedding.

29
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:19,853
A "no sex" pact, huh?

30
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:24,237
I have one of those with
every woman in America.

31
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,489
Will you give me a hand
making up the guest bedroom?

32
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,247
Cousin Cassie's staying with us
for a few days.

33
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:35,790
Cassie? I haven't seen her
in, like, forever.

34
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,961
I wonder if she still carries
a Barbie everywhere?

35
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,638
- She's 25 years old.
- So? I still...

36
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,345
You're probably right.

37
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:49,743
Pheebs, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

38
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,868
Subtle, guys.

39
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:54,330
What?

40
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:58,509
I know you're planning my
surprise bridal shower.

41
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:03,589
Okay, well, don't ruin it.
Just play along, at least.

42
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:05,713
Okay. Sorry.

43
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,395
We have to throw her a shower?

44
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,544
What'd you decide to do
about the movie?

45
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,735
I don't know. I mean...

46
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:24,433
It's not like it's porn.
This is a serious, legitimate movie.

47
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:27,040
Nudity's really important
to the story.

48
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,402
That's what you say about porn.

49
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,607
Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.

50
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:36,925
No, you should. A lot of major
actors do nude scenes.

51
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,601
The chance to star in a movie?
Come on!

52
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:45,439
That's true. And I'm only naked in
one scene. It sounds really great.

53
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,753
My character's Catholic. He falls
in love with a Jewish girl.

54
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,572
We run away and get caught
in a big rainstorm.

55
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:56,052
We go into a barn, undress each other
and hold each other.

56
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,453
It's really sweet and tender.

57
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,853
Plus, everyone will see your thing!

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,835
When can we have this shower?

59
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:10,281
She has so much going on,
we have only two options.

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,418
- We have Friday.
- That's just two days away.

61
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,656
- What is the other option?
- Yesterday.

62
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,199
If we make it yesterday, we're done!

63
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,847
It's impossible.
We can't do this by Friday.

64
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,667
We have to find a place,
invite people, get food.

65
00:04:25,878 --> 00:04:27,052
There's too much to do.

66
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,294
- We cannot do it!
- Calm down!

67
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:34,088
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,851
Just calm down, woman!

69
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,521
Phoebe, I already did.

70
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,129
All right, then I need to calm down.

71
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,512
I think we can do this
if we just get organized.

72
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:52,034
We have two days to plan this party.
We need to make fast decisions.

73
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,267
Where will we have it?

74
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:56,564
- Here. What time?
- 4:00. Food?

75
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:59,963
- Finger sandwiches and tea.
- Great! Very Monica.

76
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,578
- And chili!
- You went one too far.

77
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,086
- Flowers or balloons?
- Both.

78
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,392
- We're paying for this.
- Neither.

79
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:13,988
- What should we do for a theme?
- Lusts of the Flesh!

80
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,856
- What?
- I don't know. Cowboy theme?

81
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,829
I'm glad we decided not to sleep
together before the wedding.

82
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,098
Oh, boy. Me too.

83
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:36,184
I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
and broke up for a few hours.

84
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,391
Technically, we could have sex again.

85
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,355
What do you think,
bossy and domineering?

86
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:46,273
The wedding's off,
sloppy and immature.

87
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,806
That's me. Come on.

88
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,389
Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
We're going to lunch.

89
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:53,751
Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!

90
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,272
Shrill? The wedding is back on.

91
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,798
I thought I heard voices.
You must be Chandler.

92
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:06,493
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

93
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,648
- So, ready to go?
- Yeah.

94
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,902
- Chandler?
- I'll be right with you.

95
00:06:32,346 --> 00:06:34,919
- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
- Why?

96
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:39,054
Because "Pervie Perverson" here
can't stop staring at her.

97
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,414
Chandler, she's our cousin!

98
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,624
I wasn't staring.
I was listening intently.

99
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:48,275
It's called being a good
conversationalist. Watch.

100
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:49,908
Say something.

101
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:53,288
You were staring about eight inches
south of there.

102
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:56,904
Fine. She can stay at my place.

103
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,264
What does Cassie look like now?

104
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,143
Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

105
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,152
This Aunt Marilyn,
is she coming to the wedding?

106
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,307
Wafer-thin ice.

107
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:13,956
Hey, I'm back.

108
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,969
Hi, Joey.

109
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,580
Will I read the same scene again?

110
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,888
I tried to call you.
You didn't need to come today.

111
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,722
Oh, great.

112
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:27,138
I'd have been perfect for this part.

113
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,755
You made a bad decision and
ruined your movie. Good day!

114
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:35,867
You didn't need to come, because the
director saw your tape and loved it.

115
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,397
And, scene.

116
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:47,105
Wasn't that fun? We did
a little improv there. Yeah!

117
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,989
So, you were saying?

118
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,878
The director wants to meet you
tomorrow.

119
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,145
Wow! Sure! That's great.

120
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,647
Your agent said you're okay
with nudity.

121
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:00,924
Yeah, sure. As long as
it's handled tastefully.

122
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,530
And that barn is not too cold.

123
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,340
Perfect. There's one more thing.

124
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:15,322
It's important to the director that
everything in the movie's authentic.

125
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,791
In your love scene with Sarah...

126
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:22,385
...she talks about how she's never
seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

127
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,775
So...

128
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,159
So... what?

129
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:33,203
So, the director is insisting
that whoever play that part...

130
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:37,205
...be authentically, anatomically...

131
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:40,056
...not Jewish.
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,769
Yes!

133
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,643
No. What?

134
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:50,634
An Italian Catholic immigrant
at this time would not be...

135
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,130
Bar mitzvah-ed?

136
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:58,780
Think 13 years earlier, lose the rabbi,
add a scalpel.

137
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,638
- To get this part, you can't be...
- No.

138
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:11,793
But you are?

139
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:14,507
- You told them you weren't?
- That's right.

140
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,621
Wow!

141
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:21,426
It's definitely all gone?
There's nothing there to work with?

142
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:28,668
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know. I just want this part.

143
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:32,983
They say no matter what you're asked
during an audition, say yes.

144
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,827
They want you to ride a horse,
say you can.

145
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,158
You figure out how to do it later.

146
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:44,525
This is not like learning to ride
a horse. This is like learning...

147
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,760
...to grow a turtleneck.

148
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:58,164
I know, okay? Tomorrow,
when I go meet the director...

149
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:01,715
...I have to take my clothes off so
they can see what my body looks like.

150
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:04,563
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?

151
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:08,712
I have to call my agent
and tell her I can't do the part.

152
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,703
Unless...

153
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:14,489
Unless what?

154
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,970
This may sound crazy, but there may
be something we could...

155
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,326
...fashion.

156
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:27,501
- Like what?
- Well, I'm not sure yet.

157
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:30,212
Off the top of my head,
I'm thinking...

158
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:34,803
...double-sided tape
and some sort of luncheon meat.

159
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:45,343
I've got a great idea for party
favors for the shower.

160
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,379
We get mahogany boxes
and carve everyone's names in them.

161
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:53,309
Then inside is each person's
individual birthstone.

162
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,344
Okay. Okay.

163
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,111
You take care of that.

164
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,918
Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
and we don't have a guest list.

165
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:11,650
Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
Me. Are you?

166
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,618
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

167
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:20,242
I'm making something for Joey.
Can I raid your fridge?

168
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:22,087
Have at it.

169
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:27,447
All right. Turkey? That won't work.

170
00:11:27,658 --> 00:11:30,054
Cheese? That won't work.

171
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:33,811
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

172
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,574
Are you making him a sandwich?

173
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,290
No, it's more like a wrap.

174
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,982
Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

175
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,720
So you can get back to deciding on
what to get me for a present!

176
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,244
We have to get her a present?

177
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:00,107
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

178
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,588
It's her address book.
We have a guest list.

179
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,705
You're amazing. Did you pull
that out of her purse?

180
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,526
Uh-huh. And a little seed money
for the party.

181
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:22,831
Cassie?

182
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:24,992
Hey, Ross!

183
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,747
It's been so long!

184
00:12:29,726 --> 00:12:31,149
Last time I saw you...

185
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:35,074
...you were setting up your tent
in line for Return of the Jedi.

186
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:36,573
That's right.

187
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:41,272
So you did see me that day.
Because it seemed like you didn't.

188
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:46,179
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- It's okay. Come on in.

189
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:50,388
Thanks for letting me stay here.
Monica's place was nice.

190
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:54,005
But her fiancé sure stares a lot.

191
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:19,468
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

192
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,049
I have a knack for impressions.

193
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,417
Maybe after we get re-acquainted
you could do me.

194
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:30,953
Yeah. No!

195
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:42,919
How you doing on that...

196
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:44,595
...hot dog?

197
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,779
- I'm all done.
- Thank God.

198
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:57,392
The last time we hung out was when
our parents rented that beach house.

199
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,507
Remember the time I pinned you down
and tickled you until you cried?

200
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,340
We're probably too old to do that now.

201
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:14,403
I'll always remember that summer.
It's when I got all these freckles.

202
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,077
I'll always remember that summer...

203
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:24,007
...because that's when I realized
that we are related.

204
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:27,908
You know, we're not just
two random people thrown together.

205
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:31,632
We share genetic material.

206
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:33,998
It took you that long
to figure it out?

207
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,112
I'm a little slow.

208
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:41,094
Just as our children would be.

209
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,883
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:52,232
How are you? Good. Hi.
Thanks for coming.

211
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,836
Thank you. So nice to see you.

212
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,898
- No, thanks.
- Okay. Hey, Rach?

213
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,544
- Yeah?
- Who the hell are all these people?

214
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,303
I don't know.
I called everybody in her book.

215
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:08,369
These are the ones that could
show up on 24 hours' notice.

216
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:11,775
There's a word for people like that:
Losers.

217
00:15:13,316 --> 00:15:16,863
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
I'm the maid of honor.

218
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:20,715
- How do you know Monica?
- I was her accountant four years ago.

219
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:25,941
I'm interested to find out who's been
doing her taxes the last four years.

220
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,543
That's great.

221
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:33,730
- When is Monica supposed to get here?
- I don't know.

222
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,446
Excuse us.

223
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:41,531
- You didn't tell her?
- You were supposed to.

224
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:45,526
You were supposed to tell her to come!
I was bringing the cake!

225
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:49,768
- Fine, I'll go call her.
- And please tell her to bring a cake!

226
00:15:56,214 --> 00:16:00,971
We have a lot of options. A number
of prototypes for you to try on.

227
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:03,865
Those look great.

228
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:08,075
Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
This one is made of bologna.

229
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,027
- The toothpicks?
- Just until the glue dries.

230
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,419
Thank God.

231
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,978
These are more realistic,
but perishable.

232
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,011
Over here, we have pink suede,
which is nice.

233
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,733
But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.

234
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,410
Maybe we'll just
take that one away.

235
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:32,355
I also did a little something in fur,
but that's really just for me.

236
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,554
Why don't you try these on? We'll
get a better idea of what works.

237
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:43,320
Thanks, you are such a good friend.
And this is so weird.

238
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,635
Okay, the taffy's too sticky.

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,833
I was afraid of that.

240
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,582
- Toothpick?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,864
- What are you trying now?
- The Fruit Roll-up.

242
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:04,020
- And?
- Delicious.

243
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:10,034
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
We have a winner!

244
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,603
What? Which one?

245
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:16,264
The Silly Putty.
Not so silly anymore!

246
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:30,812
She's your cousin.
She's your cousin.

247
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:36,930
If she knew what was going on in
your head, she'd think you were sick.

248
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:47,153
Or would she?
Let's back up for a second.

249
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:52,096
She was the one who suggested
opening a bottle of wine.

250
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,269
She was the one who
turned down the lights.

251
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,193
She was the one that wanted to rent
Logan's Run...

252
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,330
...the sexiest movie ever.

253
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,793
I know that look.

254
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:12,312
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.

255
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,057
I'm going in.

256
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,599
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:29,467
Say something clever.

258
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,816
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.

259
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,849
Just has to be words. Say some words.

260
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:41,812
Any words will do.

261
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,204
Oh, my God, this is the longest...

262
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,828
...that anyone has not talked ever!

263
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,349
There is nothing you could say
to make this worse...

264
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,661
...so just say something!

265
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:04,499
I haven't had sex in a very long time.

266
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:11,075
Yeah, you really shouldn't
have said anything.

267
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:16,050
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.

268
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:20,466
I wonder what you could possibly
need me for on such short notice?

269
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:28,923
- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
- For what?

270
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,853
First, for forgetting to
throw you a bridal shower.

271
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,572
Then, forgetting to invite you to it.

272
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,434
You already had it?

273
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,193
We called everyone in your phone book.
A bunch of people came.

274
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:47,332
It took us so long to get you here
that they had to leave.

275
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:51,708
We wanted to throw you a big surprise
and a great shower.

276
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:53,837
Now you don't have either.

277
00:19:54,051 --> 00:19:55,474
We ruined everything.

278
00:19:55,686 --> 00:20:00,372
No, wait a minute, that's not true.
What you did was really sweet.

279
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:04,103
- It kind of works out for the best.
- What do you mean?

280
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:08,763
Now I get to spend my shower
with the only people I really love.

281
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:13,874
I get all those presents without
talking to people I don't even like!

282
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,779
- Surprise.
- Surprise, Monica.

283
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:31,964
What's cool is, the character
is from Naples, right?

284
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,613
My whole family's from Naples.

285
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:39,868
That's great. Okay. I've heard
everything I need to hear...

286
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,510
We just need to, uh...

287
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:44,148
Leslie?

288
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,976
- Joey, this is the awkward part.
- Hey, right. Not a problem.

289
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:51,484
I totally understand you need...

290
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,769
...to make sure I don't have any
horrible scars or tattoos.

291
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,189
Don't you worry.

292
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:00,325
I have nothing to hide.

293
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,566
So, there you go. That's me.

294
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,105
One hundred percent natural.

295
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,283
I tell you, that has never
happened before.

296
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:34,594
Cassie, are you finding
everything okay?

297
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:37,584
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me stay here.

298
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,911
Oh, it's no problem.

299
00:21:58,153 --> 00:21:59,089
What?

300
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,185
Say something. Say anything.

301
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:05,308
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
