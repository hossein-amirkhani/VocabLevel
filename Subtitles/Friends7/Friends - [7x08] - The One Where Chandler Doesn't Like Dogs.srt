1
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:05,974
-Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
-No, no, no.

2
00:00:06,218 --> 00:00:09,016
What are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,348
We're pIaying a game
I Iearned.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,115
You have to name aII the states
in si<i>x</i> minutes.

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,953
What? That's Iike insaneIy easy.

6
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:19,756
It's harder than it sounds.
You aIways forget one.

7
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:23,126
Or, in some cases, 1 4.

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,863
It's stupid and I wasn't pIaying against
peopIe, so technicaIIy, I didn't Iose.

9
00:00:29,174 --> 00:00:31,108
You forgot 1 4 states?

10
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,675
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:36,503
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,113
AII right, I got 48.

13
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,807
That's not bad. Pheebs?

14
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:44,114
I got tired of naming states,
so I decided to Iist the types of ceIery.

15
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:48,285
And I have one, reguIar ceIery.

16
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:53,491
So RacheI's got 48,
and Phoebe has the Iead in...

17
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,396
...vegetabIes. Joey?

18
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,896
Say heIIo to the new champ
of ChandIer's dumb states game.

19
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:04,139
-Wow, how many you got?
-Fifty-si<i>x</i>.

20
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:08,740
The One Where ChandIer Doesn't Like Dogs

21
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:46,346
Hey, how is New EngIand not a state?

22
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,717
They have a sports team.

23
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,851
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:55,659
There you go.

25
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:59,654
How come we have
one e<i>x</i>tra pIace setting?

26
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:01,364
You invited your assistant.

27
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,295
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

28
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:07,369
His girIfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

29
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,595
Why didn't you teII me?

30
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,105
I made him his own individuaI
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

31
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,406
I was going to,
but then I figured...

32
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:18,878
...your food is so deIicious
and perfect...

33
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:22,416
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

34
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:27,717
You'd think I wouIdn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, but I stiII do.

35
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,687
ReguIar ceIery!

36
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:32,726
I aIready have that.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,389
Done...

38
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,693
...with time to spare.

39
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:43,568
-This may be a new worId's record.
-I hate to Iecture you guys...

40
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:47,437
...but it's disgracefuI that
a group of weII-educated aduIts...

41
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:52,343
...and Joey, can't name aII the states.

42
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:57,954
You ever see a map, or one of those
round, coIorfuI things caIIed a ''gIobe''?

43
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:02,224
MageIIan? You got 46 states.

44
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:06,090
-What? That's impossibIe.
-Forty-si<i>x</i>.

45
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:09,731
WeII, who's weII-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

46
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:13,794
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

47
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,031
PIease, watch him.
Do not Iet Joey eat any of the food.

48
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,903
I am onIy one man.

49
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,704
-Okay, time is up.
-Now, just give me another minute.

50
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:27,078
If you don't know them by now,
you wiII never know them, okay?

51
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:31,312
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kiII yourseIf.

52
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:33,816
This is crazy. I can do this.

53
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:37,493
AII right, I bet I can get
aII 50 before dinner.

54
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,959
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

55
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:41,563
You're on.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,429
Don't Iook at my Iist, because there's
a Iot on there that you don't have.

57
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,264
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

58
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,342
The drawer fuII of takeout
menus is okay, right?

59
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:55,844
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

60
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,512
ChandIer, give me a hand.

61
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:04,950
Joey, do not Iet Ross Iook at maps
or the gIobe in your apartment.

62
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:08,126
Don't worry.
It's not a gIobe of the United States.

63
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:18,462
I'm gonna go out and take a waIk.

64
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,967
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

65
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,733
-Oh, it's not.
-SeriousIy, it's moving.

66
00:04:23,975 --> 00:04:27,433
-What the heII's in there?
-It's just my knitting. That's aII.

67
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,344
Yes, I knit this.

68
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm very good.

69
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:46,321
Ross' apartment is nice.
How come we don't hang out here?

70
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:48,328
Maybe because it smeIIs a weird.

71
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,797
It's Iike oId pumpkins or something.

72
00:04:51,303 --> 00:04:54,329
-That's my pie.
-Which smeIIs deIicious.

73
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:56,840
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?

74
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,010
We Ieft Joey aIone with the food.

75
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:01,478
Yep, yep, I knew it.

76
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,305
There he is...

77
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,643
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

78
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:15,190
Hi, GeIIer-Bing residence.
How can I heIp?

79
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,986
Why is a dog in our apartment?

80
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,993
I'm sorry, who's this?

81
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,190
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

82
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:26,495
TeII her I'm aIIergic, and I wiII sue!

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,065
-There's no dog here.
-Yes, there is!

84
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:33,436
He's bIack and white and shaggy.

85
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>He's sitting next to Rachel</i>
<i>and licking her hand.</i>

86
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,739
Oh, my God! Where are you?

87
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,516
I'II be right there.

88
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:46,216
They're here aIready?
How are they doing this?!

89
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,460
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:57,896
I wanted to see if your offer
was stiII good.

91
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,094
WeII, sure. Come in.

92
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,965
WeII, what happened
to your girIfriend?

93
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,436
We kind of broke up this morning.

94
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:09,080
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

95
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,909
Ohio, thank you.

96
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,088
Where's the dog?

97
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,451
What dog? There's no dog here.

98
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,750
Yeah, that dog Ieft.

99
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,068
Wait a minute. I thought we agreed to say--
Your thing. Yeah.

100
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,937
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

101
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,701
There's no dog in here.

102
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:43,811
WeII, the hiding-the-dog pIan
is off to a great start.

103
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:46,678
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

104
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,285
No, that's just me coughing.

105
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,983
Oh, good. There you are.

106
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:59,287
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

107
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,364
What is it doing here?

108
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,863
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

109
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,329
Wait.

110
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:09,502
HeIIo, my name is KIunkers.

111
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:12,833
May I pIease stay
with you nice peopIe?

112
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,213
I wish he couId stay here,
but ChandIer's aIIergic.

113
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,212
E<i>x</i>tremeIy aIIergic, okay?

114
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:22,647
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

115
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,481
...my throat wiII just cIose up.

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,217
That's odd. This dog's been
Iiving here for the past three days.

117
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,630
ReaIIy?

118
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,659
If he's been here
that Iong...

119
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:43,237
...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe
you're not aIIergic to it.

120
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:45,033
It stiII has to go, right?

121
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,403
Why?

122
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:50,379
-Okay, it's--
-Don't do it!

123
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,350
-Don't do what?
-I have to.

124
00:07:54,586 --> 00:07:56,850
Okay? It's time.

125
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,690
Okay, I hate dogs.

126
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,862
-What?!
-That's crazy? Why?

127
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,896
ToId you.

128
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,170
They are needy...

129
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:17,273
...jumpy, and you can't teII
what they are thinking...

130
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,976
...and that scares me a IittIe bit.

131
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,275
You're right. They are scary.

132
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:26,882
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

133
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,585
So you're not aIIergic? I mean, does that
mean you're not aIIergic to wooI either?

134
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:35,692
You bought me
a pink turtIeneck sweater.

135
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:38,255
The guy in the cataIog puIIed it off.

136
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,088
Wait. Do you not Iike aII dogs?

137
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,731
I mean, not even puppies?

138
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,526
Is there a puppy here?

139
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,937
-You don't Iike puppies?
-Okay, you are new.

140
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:57,311
Look, ChandIer, I toId you. Never
teII anyone about this dog thing.

141
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,483
It's Iike Ross not Iiking ice cream.

142
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:04,346
-You don't Iike ice cream?
-It's too coId!

143
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,482
It's just that dogs make me
a IittIe uncomfortabIe.

144
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,183
Hurts my teeth.

145
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:13,321
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

146
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,194
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

147
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:20,836
So either the dog goes or I go.

148
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,379
Oh, my God!

149
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,413
How can I not get this?

150
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:39,180
I'm a coIIege professor.
I got 1 450 on my SATs.

151
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:40,822
TweIve-fifty.

152
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:43,984
Damn, I forgot you were here.

153
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:46,889
We're gonna take KIunkers to Ross' .

154
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,359
We'II be back in a minute.

155
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,431
Before you go,
can I ask you a <i>q</i>uestion?

156
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:53,434
When a guy breaks up
with his girIfriend...

157
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,732
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before you make a move?

158
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,603
I'd say about a month.

159
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:01,903
ReaIIy? I'd say three to four.

160
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:03,102
HaIf-hour.

161
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,819
Interesting.

162
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:11,455
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

163
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:15,250
AII right, Rach, the big <i>q</i>uestion is,
does he Iike you?

164
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,419
Because if he doesn't Iike you,
this is aII a moo point.

165
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,829
A ''moo'' point?

166
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,839
Yeah. It's Iike a cow's opinion.

167
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:32,366
It just doesn't matter.

168
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:36,345
It's ''moo.''

169
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:46,345
Have I been Iiving with him
for too Iong, or did that aII just make sense?

170
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,652
Don't Iisten to Joey.

171
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:50,588
Okay, wouId you Iook at him?

172
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,559
He's obviousIy depressed.
He's away from his famiIy.

173
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:57,734
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

174
00:10:57,936 --> 00:11:00,496
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

175
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:04,674
-Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
-Fine, take their advice.

176
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:06,410
No one ever Iistens to me.

177
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:10,102
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

178
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:27,029
Okay, I'm keeping my end of the deaI.

179
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,758
Why is the dog stiII here?

180
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,960
-We're Ieaving.
-Okay.

181
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:35,605
-Come on.
-Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

182
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:39,102
I couId puII this off, right?

183
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:46,312
-Hey.
-Hey.

184
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:48,076
How you hoIding up?

185
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:49,976
Not bad.

186
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:53,486
-I'm sorry about your girIfriend.
-Thanks.

187
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:57,956
-Were you guys together a Iong time?
-A year, on and off.

188
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,630
I kind of thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

189
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,357
-Now that she broke up with you.
-Yeah.

190
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,261
It's weird.

191
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:11,909
I used to assume that I wouId meet
someone and faII in Iove and be happy.

192
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,171
That aII that was just a given.
LateIy, it's Iike, what if it's not?

193
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,678
Do you ever have that feeIing?

194
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,406
No.

195
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,078
Yeah.

196
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:25,422
AII the time.
ConstantIy. It's terrifying.

197
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,922
But, you know, then I figure,
it has to work out.

198
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:30,919
Why?

199
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,756
Because it has to.

200
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,534
-You reaIIy have aII the answers, don't you?
-No, no, I do. I reaIIy do.

201
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:43,400
-Thanks for taIking to me.
-Come on, what are bosses for?

202
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,006
Hug it out.

203
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,703
AII right, he Iikes you back.

204
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:53,780
ToId you, you shouId go for it.

205
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,418
What?

206
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,989
Street noise drown any of that out?

207
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:04,788
No? See you Iater.

208
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,054
Okay.

209
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,194
What did Joey say? I Iike you back?

210
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:14,833
You know-- WeII, see-- He--

211
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:20,767
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

212
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:24,277
And you were hugging me...

213
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:28,645
...so, obviousIy, you are not
repuIsed by it. Yeah!

214
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,447
-Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
-No?

215
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,152
AII right, here's the truth.

216
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:42,833
Joey said what he said...

217
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,364
...because I'm attracted to you.

218
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,863
Wow.

219
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,539
Yeah, I admit it.

220
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:55,970
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

221
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,874
...and nothing couId ever happen.

222
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,550
The Iast thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

223
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:03,754
...or make you feeI uncomfortabIe.

224
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:08,482
Which is why it wouId be reaIIy great
if you said something right about now.

225
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:12,261
Oh, my God.
Those guys are steaIing my car.

226
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:13,521
What?

227
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,131
Right there. That's my car!

228
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,665
-Hey!
-Okay, that's gonna take one minute.

229
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,464
Do you have anything eIse
you want to get off your chest?

230
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:22,900
I can't beIieve this.

231
00:14:23,174 --> 00:14:26,974
We stiII have time to taIk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

232
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,145
Look, there they go.

233
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:33,513
Okay, Phoebe.
We shouId probabIy go back now.

234
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:36,418
PIease, don't Ieave me.
I'II be IoneIy.

235
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:39,549
Stop it. Stop.

236
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:43,521
-Okay, Iet's go. We can be strong.
-Yeah, okay.

237
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:49,492
Did you hear that?
She said, ''Monica.''

238
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,095
I can't Ieave her.

239
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:56,397
We couId sneak the dog back in,
and ChandIer wouIdn't even know.

240
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:57,596
That's not gonna work.

241
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,038
I had that dog for three days,
and ChandIer had no idea.

242
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:02,677
He's not so smart.

243
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
Hey. I didn't know either.

244
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:10,017
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

245
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,954
Yeah, I knew.

246
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,118
Where's ChandIer?

247
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,956
-Here I am.
-Wash your hands.

248
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:26,927
How did you know?

249
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,133
Hey, what's she doing back here?

250
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:36,278
ReIa<i>x</i>, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

251
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:41,343
Hey, Iook, Phoebe.
I Iaid out the states geographicaIIy.

252
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,851
We don't have time for this.
We have to keep him away from my room.

253
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:48,992
-Yeah, but, Iook what--
-This is what we do not have time for!

254
00:15:53,664 --> 00:15:56,929
-Where's Monica?
-In Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

255
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:58,395
Why not?

256
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:02,903
Monica's crying.

257
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:08,242
She's very upset
about this whoIe KIunkers thing.

258
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,882
-WeII, I shouId go in there.
-No, no.

259
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:15,279
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

260
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:19,454
-Why not?
-Because you sent away the dog.

261
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,952
-That's ridicuIous.
-Oh, is it? Is it?!

262
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:29,755
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

263
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:33,835
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't Iike dogs.

264
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:37,997
So Monica and her friend PhyIIis...

265
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,941
...take away the dog, and that was the
Iast time we ever saw him. See?

266
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,945
This is just Iike that...

267
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:50,051
...onIy with a few detaiIs changed.

268
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:55,652
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

269
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,189
Bring on the food.

270
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:05,731
-What's the matter?
-Monica's upset because of KIunkers.

271
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,165
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

272
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,134
Yeah, I couId be a hero.
I couId do that.

273
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:14,571
What if it attacks me?

274
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:17,844
ChandIer, it's Iike a big gerbiI.

275
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:22,146
And that doesn't scare you?

276
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,886
Ross, you need some heIp?

277
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,759
From you?

278
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,690
Yes, pIease.

279
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:41,598
First of aII, Utah?

280
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:44,540
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

281
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:52,874
Okay, KIunkers,
come here, you big gerbiI.

282
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,209
KIunkers.

283
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,488
Where's my KIunkers, my IittIe--?

284
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:02,990
No, no, no.
I am not going to do that voice.

285
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:05,925
KIunkers.

286
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:13,501
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:17,437
Come back here,
you furry, IittIe butt-sniffer.

288
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,077
Not you, ma'am.

289
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,339
I hate America!

290
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,109
When I finish this game,
I swear, I am moving.

291
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:33,323
-Tag stiII taIking to the poIice?
-Yeah.

292
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:36,049
Damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

293
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,989
''I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you.''

294
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,356
I know that I freaked him out.

295
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,465
If you said it Iike that, you did.

296
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,300
What was I thinking?

297
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,997
I work with this man.
I have to see him every day.

298
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,402
How'd this happen to me?

299
00:18:51,575 --> 00:18:54,043
Oh, wait. That's right,
it was because of you.

300
00:18:56,814 --> 00:19:00,341
AII right, I think I can heIp you.
You wanna know what you have to do?

301
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,281
-PIease, heIp me.
-Okay, okay, okay.

302
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:06,253
Now, you're gonna want to taIk
to him about this, right?

303
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:09,860
But trust me, Rach,
that'II onIy make it worse.

304
00:19:10,027 --> 00:19:13,428
You have to deny everything.

305
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:17,695
That conversation out there,
never happened.

306
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:21,269
Joey, I don't think that's gonna work.
It was a pretty Iong conversation.

307
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,939
There was no conversation.

308
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,803
Okay. Joey, I'm just gonna taIk to Tag.

309
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,139
Who's ''Tag''? There's no ''Tag'' .

310
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:33,615
Okay. This conversation is over.

311
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,184
See? It works.

312
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:38,682
Hey, is ChandIer here?

313
00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:41,289
No, he went for a waIk.

314
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,960
Okay, you cannot teII him,
but Iook who's back.

315
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,962
WeII, no, no, no.

316
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,833
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

317
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:53,832
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

318
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:56,830
You think?

319
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,367
Hi, honey.

320
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:05,646
PIease, pIease, pIease,
don't be mad at me.

321
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,818
-What? Why wouId--?
-Wait and see.

322
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,316
Maybe we wiII, maybe we won't.

323
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:14,891
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment
to bring back KIunkers for you...

324
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,789
...and I Ieft the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

325
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:24,529
And I Iooked everywhere, aII over
the apartment, incIuding the roof.

326
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:28,704
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

327
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,007
I couIdn't find him...

328
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:36,179
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

329
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:40,975
But I do know where we can aII go
ease the pain.

330
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,751
We have good news. Look who's back!

331
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:50,694
KIunkers. Oh, my God!

332
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:55,559
-She came back aII by herseIf.
-It's a Thanksgiving miracIe.

333
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:59,835
It is so good to see you.

334
00:21:00,037 --> 00:21:02,164
She came aII the way back
from Ross' buiIding.

335
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:05,136
The things she must've seen.

336
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,503
She cIimbed up the fire escape...

337
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:12,444
...and she tapped on the window with her
teeny, IittIe paw, and we ran to Iet her in.

338
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,213
I went too far, didn't I?

339
00:21:17,154 --> 00:21:19,145
When shouId I have stopped?

340
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:29,063
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

341
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:34,371
Let me teII you something.
I have 49 states...

342
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,665
...and there are no more!

343
00:21:37,975 --> 00:21:40,944
I think I shouId be abIe
to eat something.

344
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,170
It's up to you.

345
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:50,819
-Oh, hi. How are you doing?
-I'm okay.

346
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:54,047
I gotta go down to the poIice station
and Iook at mug shots.

347
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,452
Thanks for having me over.

348
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:57,921
Tag, you're going?

349
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:00,962
We didn't even get a chance to taIk.

350
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:03,598
So where did you say
you're from again?

351
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:06,269
-CoIorado.
-What good are you?

352
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:16,444
Look, I think we shouId taIk
about what happened on the terrace.

353
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:17,944
Okay.

354
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,080
I never shouId've said what I said.

355
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,649
It just doesn't matter how I feeI.

356
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,412
We work together, so nothing couId
reaIIy ever happen between us.

357
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:31,526
I wouId Iove to go to work on Monday
and never taIk about this again.

358
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:35,663
Okay. Big day, Monday.

359
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,264

I'm not.

361
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,134
I knew it.
I freaked you out.

362
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:43,169
No, you didn't.

363
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,636
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing couId happen between us.

364
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,977
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

365
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:54,345
So pIease don't fire me
for doing this.

366
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,625
That's one Iess thing
we have to do on Monday.

367
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:30,818
DeIaware.

00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,048
DeIaware.

00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:39,787
-AII right.
