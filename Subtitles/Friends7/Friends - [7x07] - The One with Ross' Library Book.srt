1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:04,245
-Morning.
-Hi.

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:06,240
How was your date?

3
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,810
-Pretty good.
-Oh, good.

4
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:13,317
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:16,521
Okay, reaIIy good.

6
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,587
I gotta go. I'm Iate.

7
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,856
You're going to Ieave
her with me?

8
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,124
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girI.

9
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:24,733
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,464
CouId you mention I'm not Iooking
for a reIationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,506
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:35,144
Just casuaIIy sIip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,645
TeII her I'm a Ioner.
No, an outIaw.

14
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:41,978
She doesn't want to get mi<i>x</i>ed up
with the Iikes of me.

15
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,552
That's a Iot to remember.

16
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,881
Can't I teII her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,888
I'm gonna caII her Iater myseIf.

18
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,355
Honest.

19
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,655
ChandIer used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,561
He'd make e<i>x</i>tras
and Ieave them for me.

21
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,334
I'm not teIIing her anything.
It's not my responsibiIity.

22
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,801
Fine.

23
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:05,509
Now, where did we Iand
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,541
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:13,979
Sorry, but I couIdn't get
that Iock to work.

26
00:01:14,186 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah, Joey kind of disabIed it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:20,653
-You must be RacheI. I'm Erin.
-Hi.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,854
I don't mean this to sound Iike high
schooI, but did he taIk about me?

29
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,191
WouId you Iike some pancakes?

30
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,030
The One With Ross's Library Book

31
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:15,344
-Come on. Why are we here?
-Okay, okay, take a guess.

32
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,315
The hot chicks?

33
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:22,977
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the Iibrary computer earIier...

34
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:24,415
...you know, for fun.

35
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,853
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up.

36
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,957
My doctoraI dissertation.

37
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:34,256
It's right down here in the biggest
Iibrary in the university.

38
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:36,126
Wow, that's actuaIIy pretty cooI.

39
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,830
There's aIso a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

40
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,440
What is that?

41
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:51,212
Sounds Iike two peopIe are reaIIy
enjoying the Dewey DecimaI System.

42
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,319
We're so sorry.

43
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:04,355
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

44
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,731
She sent the chicken back again?

45
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,101
She said it's too dry and wants
to e<i>x</i>pIain to you how she wants it.

46
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:19,640
I'd Iike to meet this chicken e<i>x</i>pert.

47
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:21,641
Send the coIoneI in.

48
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:30,415
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,982
Lucky bastard.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,560
-Janice.
-How are you...

51
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:42,894
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

52
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,329
I'm fine.

53
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,997
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm bIind.

54
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:57,308
Somebody's been doing
a IittIe cooking outside the restaurant.

55
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,781
So who's the Iucky guy?

56
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,228
Funny story.

57
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:17,690
Hey, what's up?

58
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,337
Hey, who's your friend?

59
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,507
-Hey, Joey.
-Erin.

60
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,876
You're stiII here.

61
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:34,509
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

62
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,517
Why wouIdn't you? Erin is great.

63
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:40,054
And then there's you guys.

64
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,625
WeII, Iisten, I better get going.

65
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,227
Today was great. Thanks.

66
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,199
And, Joey, Iast night was fun.

67
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,767
Yeah. I'II caII you.

68
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,903
-I'II caII you too.
-Or I'II caII you.

69
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,766
-And caII me.
-Okay.

70
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:59,672
Look at that,
we're aII gonna caII each other.

71
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,278
Good to see you again.

72
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:03,310
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

73
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,076
The system kind of broke down, huh?

74
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,581
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couIdn't
teII her aII those things.

75
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,587
And we got to taIking, and I--

76
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,828
We want you to marry her.

77
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:18,820
What?

78
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,521
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

79
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,598
Who do you think brought her here?

80
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,200
Cupid.

81
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,873
She's so cooI.
She speaks four Ianguages.

82
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:32,908
Man, do you know what guys want.

83
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:39,581
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

84
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:43,116
She Iikes basebaII.
She had two beers at Iunch.

85
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,879
My beers?!

86
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:48,355
Look, she's a very nice girI.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,586
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

88
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,229
You aIways say that.

89
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:56,332
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it wouId go somewhere.

90
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,332
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

91
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:01,768
-Whatever.
-Fine.

92
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:04,840
Hey, don't start judging me.

93
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,975
You're in Iove with your assistant.

94
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,945
You're having an affair with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

95
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,144
Phoebe!

96
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:15,442
Secret affair.

97
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,514
What did I say?

98
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,564
Hey, cutie-cutie.

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,064
So I ran into someone you know
today at work.

100
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:35,433
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

101
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,903
Oh, my God.

102
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:44,479
I am so sorry, sweetie.

103
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,617
Are you okay?

104
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:50,284
You didn't teII her we're engaged?

105
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:53,013
-She saw the ring.
-Did she freak out?

106
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,455
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most peopIe.

107
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,058
She actuaIIy has a boyfriend herseIf.

108
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,763
Name's CIark.

109
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:05,930
She aIso invited herseIf
to our wedding.

110
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:07,569
CIark too.

111
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:11,038
You said no, right?

112
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:17,206
You said no, right?

113
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,543
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

114
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,719
-What was I supposed to do?
-Lie.

115
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,454
How hard is that?
''Your check's in the maiI.''

116
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:29,057
''Oh, your baby's so cute.''

117
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,227
''I can't wait to read your book, Ross.''

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,200
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

119
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:42,237
Think she'II sit <i>q</i>uietIy?
Think she'II want to make a toast?

120
00:07:42,474 --> 00:07:46,240
You don't think she'II want
to sing ''Part-Time Lover''?

121
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:50,744
Oh, my God. She's not gonna Iike
the chicken either, is she?

122
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,783
You know what? It'II be okay.

123
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:58,581
She's probabIy not gonna even
want to come.

124
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:02,224
-ReaIIy?
-No, that was a Iie.

125
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,752
See how easy that was?

126
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,497
So you wouId have just Iied?

127
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:10,132
Yes.

128
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:14,303
-It wouId have reaIIy been that easy?
-Yes.

129
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:17,600
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and CIark.

130
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,085
Hi.

131
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,148
What's wrong?

132
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:38,193
PeopIe are doing it
in front of my book.

133
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm sorry?

134
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:45,436
My doctoraI dissertation is in the
Iibrary at schooI. I went to see it.

135
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,901
And there were students making babies
right in the paIeontoIogy section.

136
00:08:51,776 --> 00:08:54,574
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

137
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,813
-That's not the point.
-I know that's not the point.

138
00:08:57,982 --> 00:09:00,746
I'm trying to make it the point.

139
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,381
At your schooI...

140
00:09:02,587 --> 00:09:07,684
...was there a pIace on campus
where students went to fooI around?

141
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,152
Yeah, there was.

142
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:13,887
In the corner of the Iibrary where aII
the books were that nobody ever read.

143
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:16,191
Yes, there was.

144
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:20,594
Great, because peopIe kept showing up.
I think it's Iike a thing.

145
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,496
HoId on a second.

146
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,709
Fifth fIoor, against that back waII?

147
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,777
Oh, for crying out Ioud!

148
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:35,508
-So we shouId go catch our movie.
-What's the rush?

149
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:38,449
I Iike to see the previews.

150
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,949
The candy.

151
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:45,660
-Oh, hey.
-WeII, Iook who's here.

152
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,420
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Erin.

153
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,860
-Hey, RacheI.
-Hi.

154
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,695
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

155
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:55,500
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

156
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:59,939
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

157
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:02,010
Oh, no.

158
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,038
What party?

159
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:06,180
-A birthday party.
-A birthday party.

160
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:08,717
Whose birthday party?

161
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:11,319
-AIison's birthday party.
-AIison's birthday party.

162
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,022
And how oId is AIison?

163
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,659
-Thirty-two.
-Thirty-two.

164
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,695
-I feeI so terribIe ditching you Iike this.
-No, that's okay.

165
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:26,234
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

166
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:28,895
Look how that worked out.

167
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:36,538
-You want to catch a movie?
-Yeah, sure. That wiII be fun.

168
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:38,944
Guess I'II taIk to you guys
after AIison's party.

169
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:42,883
-That, actuaIIy, might go Iate.
-I'II wait up.

170
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:53,062
E<i>x</i>cuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

171
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:58,098
Do you know the paIeontoIogy section,
fifth fIoor, stack 437?

172
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,203
WeII, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

173
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,499
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

174
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:09,946
No, no, no.

175
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,206
Can I speak to someone in charge?

176
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,109
How can I heIp?

177
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:20,689
Hi, I was wondering, is it possibIe
to increase security...

178
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,859
...in the paIeontoIogy section?

179
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:24,756
I wrote a book that's up there.

180
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,361
And instead of reading it,
peopIe are....

181
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,727
WeII, they're roIIing around
in front of it.

182
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:35,135
We are aware of the probIem
you're referring to.

183
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:43,608
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the Iibrary's understaffed.

184
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,281
I can't heIp you.

185
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,115
WeII, fine.

186
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:51,219
If I'm the onIy person
with any appreciation...

187
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:55,256
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'II go defend it myseIf.

188
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:57,884
Don't you foIIow me.

189
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:05,726
-How did it go with Erin?
-UnbeIievabIe.

190
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,938
We had the best time.

191
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,736
-So you're not mad anymore?
-No, no. You guys were totaIIy right.

192
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,174
This was much better than
the first date.

193
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,938
That was awkward.
We were both nervous.

194
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:21,242
-Didn't you sIeep together?
-Yeah, that caIms me down.

195
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:25,253
And we have so much in common.

196
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,621
She Ioves sandwiches, sports.
AIthough she is a Met fan.

197
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:33,791
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids....

198
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:37,934
Oh, my God! Listen to you taIking
about having kids.

199
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:41,467
Oh, my Joey.

200
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:43,970
PIease don't get married before I do.

201
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:57,614
I just cannot beIieve
that CIark stood me up.

202
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,317
He may stiII show up.

203
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:00,786
What are you, stupid?

204
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:05,584
-It's been three hours.
-Is that aII?

205
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:10,461
I just feeI Iike such a fooI.
I thought this guy was my souI mate.

206
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:13,001
I thought I was your souI mate.

207
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:16,970
What am I doing?

208
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:20,201
You know, Iet's just--
Oh, Iet's forget about CIark.

209
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:24,007
Let's go on to happier things.

210
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:26,740
Why don't you teII me
about your IoveIy wedding.

211
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:31,751
There was something that we wanted
to teII you about the wedding.

212
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,254
It's going to be a smaII ceremony.

213
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,153
Tiny.

214
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:41,096
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

215
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,996
It's actuaIIy going to be just famiIy.

216
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:49,039
Oh, wait.

217
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
You two think of me as famiIy?

218
00:13:57,248 --> 00:14:00,513
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

219
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:05,348
Do you want me to sing
''CareIess Whisper'' or ''Lady in Red''?

220
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,990
How can you say that?
The Mets have no cIoser.

221
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,494
-What about Benitez?
-What about game one of the series?

222
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:17,200
-What about shut up?
-You shut up.

223
00:14:18,035 --> 00:14:20,128
I Iove arguing with her.

224
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:22,202
-Be right back.
-Okay.

225
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:27,069
So how's the second-greatest
Iove affair of the century?

226
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,769
Second? Who's the first?

227
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:32,279
Me and this muffin. My God, it's deIicious.

228
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:34,715
How's it going with Joey?

229
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,854
Oh, okay.

230
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:38,487
Okay?

231
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:42,682
TeII me that you Iike him, pIease.
I mean, teII me that you Iike him.

232
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:47,258
He's a reaIIy great guy, and I know
you reaIIy want this to work out...

233
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:50,467
...but I just don't see this
having a future.

234
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,871
But you said that you Iiked him.
What happened?

235
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:58,871
Did you just change your mind?

236
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,073
-Kind of.
-Then change it back!

237
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:06,911
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no reaI spark.

238
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,983
Didn't you sIeep together?

239
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,581
Yeah.

240
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,516
Tramp.

241
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,882
Does Joey have any idea?

242
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:18,493
I don't think he does.
You know what?

243
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,493
Maybe you couId teII him
I'm not interested...

244
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:23,632
...in a serious reIationship.

245
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:27,300
You mean, Iike,
that you're kind of a Ioner?

246
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:28,937
Yeah, that'd be great.

247
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:33,004
-And maybe that you're a reaI <i>stronzo.</i>
-I'm sorry?

248
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:36,908
I guess ItaIian isn't one
of the four Ianguages you speak.

249
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,911
-Hey. Want to go?
-Yeah, Iet's go.

250
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:45,247
-Okay. See you guys Iater.
-Bye, guys.

251
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:48,318
Hey, thank you so much.

252
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,055
Wow.

253
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:56,095
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

254
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,895
No, just a reguIar oId fIying dwarf.

255
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:09,473
Yes, yes? How can I heIp you?

256
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:11,544
We were just Iooking around.

257
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:14,047
Oh, you're feIIow schoIars.

258
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:16,753
What e<i>x</i>actIy were you Iooking for?

259
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:21,118
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

260
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,816
...on the SmiIodon caIifornicus?

261
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:27,957
Get out of here!

262
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,166
Meeting someone?

263
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:42,107
Or are you just here to brush up...

264
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,281
...on Merriam's views on evoIution?

265
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:50,145
ActuaIIy, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

266
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,091
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

267
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,492
I'm sorry. Who are you?

268
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,894
I'm a professor here. Ross GeIIer.

269
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:07,831
Ross GeIIer? Why do I know that name?
It's a....

270
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,229
Wait.

271
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:14,541
Did you write this?

272
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,903
Yes.

273
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:24,019
You're the person
who checked out my book?

274
00:17:25,156 --> 00:17:29,718
You know, you Iook nothing
Iike I wouId have thought.

275
00:17:30,361 --> 00:17:31,851
You're so young.

276
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,830
WeII, I skipped fourth grade.

277
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:48,702
I am very, very sorry.

278
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:01,681
-So how was your date?
-Great. We waIked around the ViIIage.

279
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:04,554
We went to this ice-cream pIace.
SpIit a miIk shake.

280
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:06,456
Seventy-thirty, but stiII.

281
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,296
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

282
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,799
ReaIIy? She said she wants to go?

283
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:18,303
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky
because she's busy at work.

284
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,738
-She said that?
-Yes.

285
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,108
Joey, don't you think maybe
it's kind of <i>q</i>uick...

286
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:27,546
...for you to be going away together
on a trip?

287
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:32,212
Not for me. No, I want to spend
as much time with her as I can.

288
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:37,453
Okay, honey.
Joey, we need to taIk, okay?

289
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:42,255
I got the feeIing from her...

290
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:46,936
...that she's not Iooking
for a serious reIationship.

291
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,632
-Where are you getting this?
-She toId me.

292
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,874
She said she's kind of a Ioner.

293
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,719
-Joey--
-Hey, Rach, it's cooI, you know.

294
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:08,619
I'm a Ioner too, right?

295
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,093
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

296
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:18,234
I promise, ne<i>x</i>t time I wiII teII them
you're not Iooking for a reIationship.

297
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:24,068
No, don't do that. Just....

298
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:29,071
-Ne<i>x</i>t time, make sure she Iikes me.
-WeII, that too.

299
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,548
Joey?

300
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,949
-Do you want some pancakes?
-FinaIIy.

301
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,554
What are we gonna do?

302
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,793
I say we go with ''CareIess Whisper.''

303
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:53,963
ChandIer?

304
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,806
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

305
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,670
Janice, what are you doing here?

306
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:06,712
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

307
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:12,012
...but I just feIt Iike I reaIIy
couIdn't be aIone tonight.

308
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:21,460
I was just wondering if I couId maybe
stay here with you.

309
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:25,032
Just, I reaIIy feeI Iike I need
to be with famiIy.

310
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:30,165
Our kids are gonna caII her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

311
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:35,678
PIease. Because otherwise,
I reaIIy don't know what I might do.

312
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:39,979
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

313
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:43,715
-Do you have any tissues?
-Yeah, in the bathroom.

314
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,321
We'II just Iet her stay.

315
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:53,725
No. If we Iet her stay,
she wiII stay forever.

316
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:58,197
-Kind of Iike your BarcaIounger.
-Is that what you're thinking about?

317
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,199
I never stop thinking about it.

318
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:04,901
-What are we going to do?
-Nothing. We'II just have to Iet her stay.

319
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,543
We can't. We gotta fight!

320
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,674
Fight!

321
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:13,174
ChandIer, she has beaten me.

322
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,113
I'm tired, ChandIer.

323
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,686
So very tired!

324
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:20,454
Hey, you guys?

325
00:21:20,691 --> 00:21:23,717
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

326
00:21:26,096 --> 00:21:27,927
Janice, I'm sorry...

327
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:31,498
...but you can't stay here tonight.

328
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,194
Why not?

329
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:34,962
HonestIy?

330
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,436
Our apartment is a hotbed...

331
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,234
...for eIectromagnetic activity.

332
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,072
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadIy...

333
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:49,343
...you have not.

334
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm gonna need a comforter.

335
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:00,920
Do you have a hypoaIIergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasaI.

336
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:07,926
Do you have a cat?
Because it's aIready happening.

337
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,997
Do you hear that? Listen.

338
00:22:14,278 --> 00:22:16,644
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

339
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:17,836
Why?

340
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:23,178
Because ChandIer stiII has
feeIings for you.

341
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,950
He does?

342
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,020
Say again?

343
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,059
That's right. That's right.

344
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:36,357
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

345
00:22:36,634 --> 00:22:39,762
And probabIy why you shouIdn't come
to the wedding.

346
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,801
FeeIings. Such strong feeIings.

347
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:50,044
I mean, I reaIize that his feeIings
may never compIeteIy go away...

348
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,306
...but you can.

349
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:56,215
Oh, my God.

350
00:22:56,487 --> 00:23:00,082
I understand. I am so sorry.

351
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:01,723
I'II go.

352
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:08,588
Goodbye, Monica.

353
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:12,893
I wish you a Iifetime
of happiness with him.

354
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,161
ChandIer.

355
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:18,437
You caII me when this goes
in the pooper.

356
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,521
I got this section covered.

357
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,725
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in peopIe's eye--

358
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:37,690
Okay, see you Iater.

359
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,338
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.

360
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:57,970
