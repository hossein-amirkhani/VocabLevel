1
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:07,144
ChandIer, you're doing so weII
with this whoIe getting married...

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,983
...never gonna sIeep with anyone for the
rest of your Iife thing. I thinks it's great.

3
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,185
-Hey. Who wants French toast?
-I'II have some.

4
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:20,524
Me too. Eggs and miIk in the fridge.
Thanks.

5
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,201
-What's the matter?
-My hand feeIs weird.

6
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,338
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

7
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,801
-When wiII that start getting annoying?
-Start?

8
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,369
Let's start the wedding pIans.

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,741
-Okay.
-AIready?

10
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:41,111
We got a Iot to do. We gotta think
about the fIowers, the music--

11
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:44,186
-I have thoughts on the music--
-ChandIer. Too many cooks.

12
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:50,187
Take it from me. AII you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

13
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:57,958
-What in God's name is that?
-Oh, my God, the wedding book?

14
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:00,569
I haven't seen that since fourth grade.

15
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:05,899
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, Iocations, for instance:

16
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:09,875
First organized aIphabeticaIIy,
then geographicaIIy...

17
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:12,414
...then by s<i>q</i>uare footage.

18
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:16,387
That is so smart.

19
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:19,056
Break it off. Break it off now.

20
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:24,085
Look, here's the invitation you used to your
wedding to John Lynch in the fifth grade.

21
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:28,255
Remember how I got sick
and Ross had to fiII in as a bridesmaid?

22
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:32,793
I was a brides-boy.

23
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,967
I don't smeII French toast, brides-boy.

24
00:01:38,844 --> 00:01:40,971
The One With RacheI's Book

25
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:18,673
That concIusiveIy proves...

26
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:22,681
...that I had the idea
for <i>Jurassic Park</i> first.

27
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,546
Let's take a Iook--

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,117
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

29
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,886
I need to taIk to you. It's urgent.
It's about Monica and ChandIer.

30
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:33,529
Oh, my God. Of course.

31
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,525
WouId you pIease e<i>x</i>cuse me
for a moment?

32
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:40,363
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you...?

33
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:42,706
What's going on?

34
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:47,504
WeII, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged...

35
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,009
...it wouId be nice
if they have privacy.

36
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:53,878
So couId I just move in with you
for a coupIe days?

37
00:02:56,855 --> 00:03:00,518
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and ChandIer?

38
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:02,921
Nothing. Why?

39
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:06,687
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

40
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:10,061
Yeah, it is.
My movie starts in, Iike, five minutes.

41
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:17,403
Do you reaIize I have a cIassroom
fuII of students?

42
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,375
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

43
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:29,550
I haven't cIeared the
budget with my parents...

44
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:31,914
...but teII me how this is for music:

45
00:03:32,357 --> 00:03:35,884
A string <i>q</i>uartet for the processionaI,
a jazz trio for cocktaiIs...

46
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,392
...the Bay City RoIIers
for dancing....

47
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,531
Wait, that was
for my si<i>x</i>th grade wedding.

48
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:46,333
You couIdn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't even pIay anymore and Derek....

49
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,773
Derek is a name I shouIdn't know.

50
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:55,639
Mon, do you have another piIIow,
something a IittIe snuggIier?

51
00:03:55,914 --> 00:03:59,042
Why are you napping here
instead of at your pIace?

52
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:01,344
-The duck.
-What-- The duck?

53
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,919
What the heII
did the damn duck do now?

54
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,249
WeII, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

55
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:12,759
...and it was immediateIy found
and properIy cIeaned up.

56
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,665
Do I get to Iook at this book...

57
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:19,132
...or is it just for peopIe
invoIved in the wedding?

58
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:23,097
Of course you can Iook at it.
I want your opinion.

59
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,400
Here you go.

60
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,168
-What about centerpieces?
-Centerpieces!

61
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:30,437
-Roses or IiIies?
-DefiniteIy roses.

62
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:36,811
I think they're more ''wedding-y.''

63
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,758
-But IiIies are the cIear choice.
-Oh, my God, it's Iike one mind.

64
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:49,692
Guys, guys, you gotta Iet me nap.

65
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,432
I'm gonna get cranky.

66
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:56,830
Joey, there's a perfectIy good couch
across the haII.

67
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,340
Yes, it is perfectIy good...

68
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:03,047
...and it is not one of the pIaces
the duck got sick.

69
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,139
What?

70
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:09,651
-AII right, I'm gonna go.
-Joey, what did the duck do?

71
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:12,856
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

72
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,870
Hey, IittIe buddy. How you feeIing?

73
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,939
What the heII is in that face cream?

74
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,754
That's so soft.

75
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:54,559
PiIIowcases!

76
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,080
<i>''Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.</i>
<i>Her father, the vicar</i>-- <i>''</i>

77
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,614
<i>Vicar?</i>

78
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,186
<i>''</i>--<i>wouldn't be home for hours.</i>

79
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,358
<i>Her loins were burning.</i>

80
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:26,690
<i>She threw caution to the wind</i>
<i>and reached out and grabbed his</i>-- <i>''</i>

81
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,561
This is a dirty book!

82
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,213
Phoebe?

83
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,054
Oh, Ross, hi.

84
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:57,555
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Sorry, I'm with a cIient right now.

85
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:02,033
-Phoebe!
-Okay, Iet's taIk outside.

86
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,928
UnfortunateIy, this time wiII be counted
as part of your massage.

87
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,539
So try...

88
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,040
...and think reIa<i>x</i>ing thoughts.

89
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,474
And don't touch any of my dinosaurs.

90
00:07:14,646 --> 00:07:17,911
I know they're cooI, but they're mine.

91
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,887
Phoebe, you can't massage peopIe
in my apartment.

92
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:25,621
I did it at Monica and ChandIer's.

93
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,485
And they knew about it?

94
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,821
Okay, Ross, what is this reaIIy about?

95
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:38,300
This is my home and I want to be
abIe to come and go when I want.

96
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:41,904
I wiII find somepIace eIse
to do the rest of my appointments.

97
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:43,902
I don't know what the big deaI is.

98
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:47,078
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

99
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:51,578
...when I want to kick back
with a puzzIe-- Beer, coId beer.

100
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,477
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

101
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,723
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

102
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:04,087
No.

103
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,490
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

104
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,728
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

105
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,875
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

106
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:29,811
Joey, where did you Iearn that word?

107
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,118
Where do you think...

108
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:35,883
...ZeIda?

109
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:42,028
-You found my book?!
-Yeah, I did!

110
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:46,027
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

111
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:50,332
I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
I know I shouIdn't have, but you got porn!

112
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,369
God! I cannot beIieve you invaded
my privacy Iike that!

113
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:58,311
ZeIda.

114
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:03,217
Now, you seem a IittIe tense. Maybe
you'II reIa<i>x</i> if I gave you a nice miIk bath.

115
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:05,481
Okay, you know what?

116
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,959
-I don't even Iike that part.
-Oh, I do.

117
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,460
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

118
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:18,533
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a IittIe erotica.

119
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:22,637
It's just a heaIthy e<i>x</i>pression
of femaIe se<i>x</i>uaIity...

120
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:26,867
...which, by the way, is something
that you wiII never understand.

121
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,041
You got porn.

122
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,672
-HeIIo.
-Hi, is Phoebe here?

123
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,867
-No, she's out for the night.
-Oh, great.

124
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,013
Can I heIp you with something?

125
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,247
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

126
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,384
Yes, I am.

127
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,755
Great! Dad?

128
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:21,265
Thank you so much.
I'II pick him up in an hour.

129
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,740
You need heIp with that?

130
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:42,714
Your parents must've been thriIIed
when you toId them you were engaged.

131
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:45,184
Oh, yeah.
I shouId probabIy caII them.

132
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:48,488
I remember when we first got engaged.

133
00:10:48,693 --> 00:10:50,854
-I've never heard that story.
-Dad, you don't--

134
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,292
WeII, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

135
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,629
I stiII don't know how.

136
00:10:56,935 --> 00:11:01,463
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

137
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:06,238
What a sweet story.

138
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:10,213
At Ieast you're not hearing it
at your fifth grade HaIIoween party.

139
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:12,075
They wanted a scary story.

140
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:16,084
We're reaIIy e<i>x</i>cited
about our wedding pIans.

141
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:20,518
I guess pretty soon we'II be making a big
withdrawaI from the Monica wedding fund.

142
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,891
-What?
-You teII her, Jack. I can't do it.

143
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,657
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

144
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:34,099
We have it.
OnIy, now we caII it ''the beach house.''

145
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:39,536
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

146
00:11:39,777 --> 00:11:41,244
We're sorry. We assumed...

147
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:44,312
...that if you got married after 30
you'd pay for it yourseIf.

148
00:11:44,782 --> 00:11:47,148
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

149
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,679
So you've had seven years
of beach fun...

150
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:52,149
...and you can't put a price on that.

151
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,659
We do feeI bad about this.

152
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,692
We saved again
when you dated Richard...

153
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:01,591
...then that went to heII,
so we redid the kitchen.

154
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:05,959
What about ChandIer?

155
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,502
It was ChandIer.
We didn't think he'd propose.

156
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:13,475
CIearIy I did not start drinking
enough at the start of the meaI.

157
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,572
I can't beIieve there's no money
for my wedding.

158
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:18,874
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried...

159
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,813
...to seII ice over the Internet.

160
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,683
-It seemed Iike such a simpIe idea.
-Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

161
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:29,154
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

162
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,793
Good Iuck, ChandIer.

163
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:59,354
Okay, now I'm going to...

164
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,655
...touch you.

165
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:13,904
That's soft.

166
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,973
Why does Joey keep taIking
about chimney sweeps and vicars?

167
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:55,011
I thinks he's just been rehearsing
for an episode of his show.

168
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:58,946
Because it reaIIy sounds
Iike a bad porn noveI.

169
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:03,819
Do you think your parents
couId heIp pay for it?

170
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,010
I don't know.

171
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:09,455
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

172
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,026
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

173
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,029
And any e<i>x</i>tra cash my father has
he saves for his yearIy trips to...

174
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:19,132
...DoIIywood.

175
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:25,033
-What happened at dinner?
-My parents spent the wedding fund.

176
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:28,403
My God, what did you order?

177
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:34,546
Wait, there's no money?
WeII, this is terribIe.

178
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:38,278
You guys are gonna have to get
married in, Iike, a rec center.

179
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:41,052
Oh, my God, you're right.

180
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:45,685
We're gonna have to be out by 6 so they
can take out the fIoor for senior swim.

181
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:50,493
-Honey, it's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not gonna be okay.

182
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:55,235
-No swing band, no IiIies.
-No, but that's good.

183
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,704
You don't want IiIies.

184
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,639
If a cat ate them, it wouId die.

185
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:07,707
-What?
-I'm just saying, now you couId invite cats.

186
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,487
It's gonna be okay.

187
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:14,420
I mean, you don't need to have this...

188
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:17,526
...rustic ItaIian feast.

189
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,923
You don't need this custom-made...

190
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:24,225
...empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

191
00:15:24,469 --> 00:15:26,164
You can wear off-the-rack.

192
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:33,166
It's reaIIy gonna be okay.

193
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:37,541
The important thing is that we Iove each
other and we're gonna get married.

194
00:15:37,782 --> 00:15:41,445
Do you even understand what
''off-the-rack'' means?

195
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:45,321
Why don't you pay for it yourseIf?

196
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,013
How? I don't have any money.

197
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,249
-WeII, I have some.
-How much?

198
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,518
WeII, cIose to....

199
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,366
-Are you kidding me?!
-How much?

200
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:08,477
-Enough for wedding scenario A.
-ReaIIy?

201
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:14,249
Scenario A has IiIies. Someone's gonna have
to break it to the cats and it won't be me.

202
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,982
How great are you, you IittIe saver!

203
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:21,258
This is e<i>x</i>actIy
the budget of my dream wedding.

204
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,394
You guys are so made for each other.

205
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,966
You're not suggesting that we spend
aII of the money on the wedding?

206
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,792
Yeah.

207
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:36,000
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for si<i>x</i> years...

208
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:40,473
...and I kind of had some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

209
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:44,341
HeIIo, Mr. ChandIer.

210
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:50,610
Sweetie, this is the most speciaI day
of our Iives.

211
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:54,723
I reaIize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend aII the money on one party.

212
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,189
Honey, I Iove you.

213
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:00,862
But if you caII our wedding
a party one more time...

214
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:02,690
...you may not get invited.

215
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:09,429
We can aIways earn more money.
We're onIy gonna get married once.

216
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,077
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

217
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:17,508
You're gonna have to ''put your foot down''?

218
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:20,013
Yes, I am.

219
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:25,147
Money and a firm hand.

220
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,983
FinaIIy a ChandIer I can get on board with.

221
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,001
-Hey, Rach.
-Joey.

222
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:43,501
Hey, Rach, do you smeII smoke?

223
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:47,974
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

224
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:52,114
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smeII it?

225
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,043
Something's on fire.

226
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,216
No, I don't smeII anything.

227
00:17:56,787 --> 00:18:00,120
Oh, you know what? It's probabIy
just your burning Ioins.

228
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:07,864
-Hey, what are you guys taIking about?
-Nothing.

229
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,400
Damn, this coffee's coId.

230
00:18:13,604 --> 00:18:15,799
Do you mind if I heat this up
on your Ioins?

231
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,610
You know, I cannot beIieve
you toId him. Joey....

232
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:27,212
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

233
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:31,080
Yeah, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

234
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:33,818
Oh, yeah?

235
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:38,027
WeII, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

236
00:18:39,096 --> 00:18:40,290
What's up?

237
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:45,725
Ross, how couId you do that
to an oId man?

238
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:50,102
E<i>x</i>cuse me, Iadies.

239
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:52,598
I'm sorry?

240
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,176
My massage cIient, Arthur.

241
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,314
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me...

242
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:00,449
...gave him a reaIIy weird massage.

243
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:03,552
I gave him an e<i>x</i>tremeIy
professionaI massage.

244
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:07,147
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

245
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:10,122
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditionaI massage.

246
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:13,455
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

247
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:17,862
...and I gentIy e<i>x</i>foIiated him
with a mop.

248
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:23,870
WeII, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

249
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:27,339
This is your fauIt.
You didn't move his appointment.

250
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:30,444
Oh, it's my fauIt?
You didn't have to massage him.

251
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:31,706
You couId've sent him away.

252
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:35,008
You couId've not roIIed Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

253
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,315
He said he Iiked that!

254
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:44,727
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,293
Dude, what are you massaging
an oId man for?

256
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,868
-His daughter was hot.
-Gotcha.

257
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,872
Look, Ross,
I reaIIy need that $80 every week.

258
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:01,705
I'm sure you'II find
another massage cIient, Phoebe.

259
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,576
Yeah, I'm sure I wiII too. But untiI then,
I'm going to massage you every week...

260
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,651
-...for the price of $ 1 00.
-You just said 80.

261
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:10,810
You want me to mess up your puzzIe?

262
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,149
A hundred it is.

263
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,131
HeIIo, ZeIda.

264
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:32,337
-Who are you supposed to be?
-The vicar.

265
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:37,171
-Do you even know what a vicar is?
-Like a goaIie, right?

266
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,940
Look, that's enough.

267
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:42,608
The joke's over. I'm sick of it.

268
00:20:42,787 --> 00:20:46,484
You mean this isn't the sweet torment
you've been waiting aII your Iife for?

269
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:49,148
Joey, I'm serious, aII right? It's enough.

270
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:52,318
You make stupid jokes
and sIeazy innuendoes...

271
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,428
...and it's just not funny anymore.

272
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:57,931
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

273
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:02,435
Maybe I couId make it up to you
by taking you roughIy in the barn.

274
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:08,476
AII right, that's it.
You wanna do it? Let's do it.

275
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,382
That's right.
I wanna do it with you.

276
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:19,850
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said aII the right things.

277
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:21,318
I did?

278
00:21:21,592 --> 00:21:24,891
Yeah. Oh, I've been waiting so Iong
to get on that body.

279
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,363
-This body?
-Yeah, that's right.

280
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,657
Come on, Joey, se<i>x</i> me up.

281
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:34,531
You're starting to sound Iike
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

282
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,032
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Get those cIothes off.

283
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:43,509
But I'd keep that heImet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

284
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:46,513
I don't want to. I'm scared.

285
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:56,151
Listen...

286
00:21:58,395 --> 00:22:00,488
...I've been thinking.

287
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:04,998
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend aII of your money on our wedding.

288
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,171
I mean, you work reaIIy hard for that.

289
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:10,598
-WeII.
-WeII, you work for that.

290
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,338
Look, I've thought about it too.

291
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:20,016
I'm sorry. I think we shouId spend
aII of the money on the wedding.

292
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:24,885
-You do?
-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

293
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,420
Look, when I proposed,
I toId you...

294
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:33,060
...that I wouId do anything
to make you happy.

295
00:22:33,297 --> 00:22:36,630
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

296
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:38,994
...then that's what we're gonna do.

297
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,803
You are so sweet.

298
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:48,871
What about the future and stuff?

299
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,411
Forget about the future and stuff.

300
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,014
So we onIy have two kids.

301
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,050
We'II pick our favorite and
that one wiII get to go to coIIege.

302
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:00,716
-Have you thought about that?
-Yeah.

303
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,550
How many kids were we gonna have?

304
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,526
Four. A boy, twin girIs
and another boy.

305
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,164
What eIse did you think about?

306
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,336
WeII, stuff Iike where we'd Iive,
you know.

307
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:16,232
Like a smaII pIace outside the city...

308
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,671
...where our kids couId Iearn
to ride their bikes.

309
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:22,777
We couId have a cat that had a beII
on its coIIar...

310
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:27,541
...and we couId hear it every time
it ran through the IittIe kitty door.

311
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:31,812
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey couId grow oId.

312
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:38,556
You know what?

313
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:42,459
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

314
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,998
-Sure you do.
-No.

315
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,269
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

316
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:53,774
You sure?

317
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,811
-I Iove you so much.
-I Iove you.

318
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:08,823
When you were taIking
about our future, you said cat.

319
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,856
But you meant dog, right?

320
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,299
-Yeah, totaIIy.
-Oh, good.

321
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,937
Room temperature okay?

00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,342
-E<i>x</i>ceIIent. Is the music too Ioud?

323
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:28,808
Good.

324
00:24:34,418 --> 00:24:36,579
-What the heII are you doing?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:40,713
Were you e<i>x</i>pecting a traditionaI massage
with the hands?

326
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:43,189
Fine.
