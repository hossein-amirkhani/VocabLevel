1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,396
-You ready to go?
-Let me just finish this.

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,802
Hey, Ross. Check this out.

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,275
Yeah, I can<i>'</i>t do that.

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,649
-What are you doing?
-Have you seen this?

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,251
It<i>'</i>s our new aIumni website
for coIIege.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:24,150
You can post messages for peopIe,
Iet everyone know what you<i>'</i>re up to.

7
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,760
Oh, great. A faster way to teII peopIe
that I'm unempIoyed and chiIdIess.

8
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,931
It<i>'</i>s actuaIIy interesting to find
out what peopIe are doing.

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,531
Remember Andrea Rich?

10
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,860
That taII girI that wouIdn<i>'</i>t sIeep
with you?

11
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,835
WeII, her Internet company went under,
and she Iost an ear in a boating accident.

12
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,666
Bet she<i>'</i>d sIeep with you now.

13
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,672
No, I aIready e-maiIed her.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,681
Let me see what you wrote
about yourseIf.

15
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,844
''Doctor of paIeontoIogy, two kids.''

16
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,651
Wait a second. You spIit with CaroI
because you had different interests?

17
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:04,286
I think you spIit with CaroI because
you had one very simiIar interest.

18
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,299
I'm gonna finish this Iater, okay?
Let me just grab my coat.

19
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,561
Okay!

20
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,032
What, did you think you Iearned how
to do it in the Iast two minutes?

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,314
Maybe we finish this for him.

22
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:31,687
AIso, I cIoned a dinosaur in my Iab.

23
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,361
She is now my girIfriend.

24
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,790
I don<i>'</i>t care what society says,
it<i>'</i>s the best sex I<i>'</i>ve ever had.

25
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:46,400
-And send.
-No, no-- You can<i>'</i>t do that to him.

26
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,597
-AII right, Iet<i>'</i>s go.
-Dude!

27
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:53,302
I think you made it cIear you can<i>'</i>t be
trusted with the baII inside the house.

28
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,047
And send.

29
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,325
Hey. How was basketbaII?

30
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,398
It was fun. Right up untiI ChandIer
got a finger in the eye.

31
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,432
Oh, no! Who did that?

32
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,001
ChandIer. Yeah.

33
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,302
Hey!

34
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,402
-Rach?
-Yeah?

35
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,578
What<i>'</i>s Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?

36
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,910
She was just crawIing around and found
him, so I just Iet her sIeep with him.

37
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,781
-That<i>'</i>s aII right, isn<i>'</i>t it?
-Of course. Yeah.

38
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:14,222
It<i>'</i>s a stuffed animaI, you know?
It<i>'</i>s for kids. Not for aduIts.

39
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,089
I know that.

40
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,196
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you Iove him.

41
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:24,564
RacheI, Iet<i>'</i>s be cIear on this, okay?
I do not Iove Huggsy.

42
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,567
I Iike him a normaI amount.

43
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,343
AII right. WeII, Emma Ioves him.

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,945
Yeah. WeII, why wouIdn<i>'</i>t she?
He<i>'</i>s a wonderfuI person!

45
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,712
-Hi.
-Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

46
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,154
-You feeIing better?
-Breaking up sucks.

47
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,159
-Oh, I reaIIy miss Mike.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

48
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,162
I've tried everything to feeI better.
I even tried writing a song about it...

49
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,461
...but I can<i>'</i>t think of anything
that rhymes with:

50
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,330
Oh, I so know how you feeI.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,206
Breaking up with Richard was
the hardest thing I've ever done in my Iife.

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,542
AII right, fine, I'II put another doIIar
in the Richard jar.

53
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,189
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your heIp getting through this.

54
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,551
You're saying you<i>'</i>re
not gonna need my heIp?

55
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,989
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...

56
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,528
...to hear crueI, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.

57
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:29,657
Oh, good, because I<i>'</i>ve aIready thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth!

58
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,194
Okay. I mean, I know
I did the right thing.

59
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,998
Mike never wants to get married...

60
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,109
...and I shouIdn<i>'</i>t be in a reIationship
that has no future.

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,610
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,749
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,214
Okay, you got it.

64
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,622
UnIess....
Am I being too crazy about this?

65
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,660
AII right, so there<i>'</i>s no future. But that
doesn<i>'</i>t mean we stiII can<i>'</i>t have fun.

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,557
-You know what? Forget what I said.
-ReaIIy?

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,497
-AII right, if that<i>'</i>s what you want.
-That was a test, and you just faiIed.

68
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,530
Damn it! Rookie mistake!

69
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,170
I have sex with dinosaurs?

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,479
I beIieve I read that somewhere.

71
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:24,052
Not onIy is it not funny,
it<i>'</i>s physicaIIy impossibIe! Okay?

72
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:29,388
Depending on the species, I<i>'</i>d have
to have a 6-foot-Iong-- It<i>'</i>s not funny!

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,188
I respectfuIIy disagree.

74
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,765
I can<i>'</i>t beIieve you put that
on my aIumni page.

75
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,562
-Who cares? Nobody reads those.
-You better hope not...

76
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,035
...because I just read what
you put on your page.

77
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,573
-I don<i>'</i>t have a page.
-Oh, I respectfuIIy disagree!

78
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,088
Huggsy?

79
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,450
Huggsy?

80
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,421
Huggsy.

81
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,858
I want my penguin.

82
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,871
<i>Look at you. All sweet and innocent,</i>
<i>sleeping like an angel.</i>

83
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,010
<i>With Emma's chubby little hands</i>
<i>wrapped around you.</i>

84
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,413
It<i>'</i>s okay, Emma. You stay asIeep.

85
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,960
Step away from the crib!
I have a weapon!

86
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,896
It<i>'</i>s okay! It<i>'</i>s okay, Rach!
It<i>'</i>s me! Put down the scrunchie.

87
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,500
-What are you doing?
-WeII, I heard Emma stirring...

88
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,197
...so I came in to make sure
she couId reach Huggsy.

89
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,938
Oh, thanks. AII right, weII, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

90
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:56,673
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

91
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,143
This isn<i>'</i>t over!

92
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,683
Wait a second. Why wouId
Ross teII everyone in your cIass...

93
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,726
...that you are ''as gay
as the day is Iong''?

94
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,860
Because I toId everyone
he sIept with dinosaurs.

95
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:20,336
WeII, that<i>'</i>s cIearIy a joke.
This couId easiIy be true.

96
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:26,074
WouId you get that, pIease? PeopIe have
been caIIing to congratuIate me aII day.

97
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,675
HeIIo?

98
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,877
No, he<i>'</i>s not here.
Yeah, this is his wife.

99
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,056
Yeah. WeII, it came
as quite a shock to me too!

100
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:44,890
WeII, I guess I shouId<i>'</i>ve known. He just
kept making me watch <i>Moulin Rouge.</i>

101
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,691
Hang up! Hang up!

102
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,857
And that was a great movie.

103
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,568
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.

104
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,105
Oh, yeah, this<i>'</i>II show him.
Here we go.

105
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,675
-What are you doing?
-Oh, you<i>'</i>II see, my friend!

106
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,708
I'm dead?

107
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,749
And so young.

108
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,224
Posting that I died?
That reaIIy isn<i>'</i>t funny.

109
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,395
WeII, how you died was funny.

110
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,259
Oh, pIease. Hit by a bIimp?

111
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:25,197
It kiIIs over one Americans every year.

112
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:29,237
UnbeIievabIe. My cIassmates
are gonna think I'm dead.

113
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,468
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone caIIs!

114
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,636
You<i>'</i>re messing with
peopIe<i>'</i>s feeIings here.

115
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,442
You wanna taIk about peopIe<i>'</i>s feeIings?
You shouId have heard how hurt...

116
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,645
...Professor Stern was when I toId him
I wouIdn<i>'</i>t be abIe to go to Key West!

117
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,423
You<i>'</i>ve reaIIy crossed a Iine here.
But that<i>'</i>s okay.

118
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,390
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...

119
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,120
...and a stack of gay porn.

120
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55,427
That<i>'</i>s right. Your coming-out
is about to get reaI graphic!

121
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,969
God, I wish Mike were here.

122
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,605
Okay, if Mike were here, what
wouId the two of you be doing?

123
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,782
What are you, animaIs?
It<i>'</i>s 4:00 in the afternoon.

124
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,610
I gotta caII him. Just to taIk to him.
There<i>'</i>s no harm in that.

125
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:21,192
That<i>'</i>s how it starts. ''I don<i>'</i>t need
to eat the cake, I'II just smeII the icing.

126
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,456
Why not just a IittIe sIiver?''
Or, ''Okay, just a sIice or two.''

127
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,826
The next thing you know,
you<i>'</i>re 21 0 pounds...

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,798
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunneI sIide!

129
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,130
-That's not true, is it?
-They had to cut me out...

130
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,004
...with the Jaws of Life.

131
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,842
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.

132
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,245
But Iook, if you taIk to him,
then you<i>'</i>re gonna want to see him.

133
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,182
And if you see him, you<i>'</i>re gonna
wanna get back together.

134
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,084
And I know that<i>'</i>s not what you want.

135
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,085
AII right, so give me your phone.

136
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,225
Here.

137
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,658
-And now your ceII.
-Okay.

138
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,037
There you go.

139
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,078
-This is your ceII phone?
-Yes.

140
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,616
This is your current ceII phone?

141
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,554
Yes. It reminds me of a simpIer time.

142
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,585
Phoebe? Where<i>'</i>s your purse?

143
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,691
-Hey! No!
-No!

144
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,629
-Give it to me!
-You can<i>'</i>t have it!

145
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,894
-Give it to me!
-No!

146
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,973
-I<i>'</i>II go in there!
-Oh, yeah.

147
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,369
-Phoebe, come here!
-No!

148
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,478
-Give it to me!
-You're crazy!

149
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,042
Damn you, Monica GeIIer hyphen Bing!

150
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,288
Don't even think of sneaking out
and using a pay phone...

151
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,154
...because I am everywhere, baby!

152
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:10,430
Hey, Iook who<i>'</i>s here. It<i>'</i>s Joey.
And he brought home a friend.

153
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,766
Emma<i>'</i>s right here. You promised not to
bring girIs home in the middIe of the day!

154
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,875
No, no, no, it<i>'</i>s not a girI. It<i>'</i>s...

155
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,774
...a brand-new Huggsy!

156
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,245
Oh! Oh, that<i>'</i>s so great!
Now Emma has two Huggsies!

157
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,477
No, no. Oh, no.
No, Emma has one Huggsy.

158
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,383
The new Huggsy.

159
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,117
The other Huggsy, I don<i>'</i>t know,
I guess I<i>'</i>II just take him back.

160
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:39,162
You know what? When I was a IittIe girI,
I had a IittIe pink pony named Cotton.

161
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,825
Oh, I Ioved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I wouId braid her taiI--

162
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,971
Make the transfer!

163
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,069
ShouId I be concerned that a button feII
off the oId Huggsy and I can<i>'</i>t find it?

164
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,182
No, don<i>'</i>t worry about it.
I swaIIowed that years ago. Hey!

165
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,012
Oh, what? I don<i>'</i>t think
she Iikes the new Huggsy.

166
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,087
-But he<i>'</i>s the same.
-I think she wants the oId one back.

167
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,284
-Yeah, but he<i>'</i>s the same.
-Joey, come on.

168
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,123
But he<i>'</i>s the same!

169
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,294
You<i>'</i>re not the same.

170
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,531
You know, it<i>'</i>s a Iot
Iess surprising to do that...

171
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,007
...after I<i>'</i>ve buzzed you
into the buiIding.

172
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,646
So, Phoebe, why are there
men<i>'</i>s shoes by the door?

173
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,918
Those are my shoes.

174
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,214
WeII, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.

175
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,849
Look, Monica, I reaIIy appreciate
you checking in on me.

176
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,494
-But I'm actuaIIy feeIing a Iot better.
-You are?

177
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,096
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be aIone right now.

178
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,865
-Who<i>'</i>s that?
-I ordered Chinese food.

179
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,100
What are the chances?!

180
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,244
One biIIion Chinese peopIe,
and they send Mike!

181
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,515
-What are you doing here?
-Phoebe caIIed me.

182
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,311
-Phoebe!
-I'm sorry. I broke down.

183
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,786
I wanted to see him.

184
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,822
WeII, not on my watch.

185
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,921
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even caII him?

186
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,393
There<i>'</i>s a speakerphone
on the base unit.

187
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,634
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!

188
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,567
-Can I come in?
-No! No.

189
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,937
Phoebe, isn't seeing Mike exactIy what
you wanted me to stop you from doing?

190
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,543
-Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
-This doesn<i>'</i>t concern you!

191
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,283
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.

192
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,251
Look, guys, you can<i>'</i>t do this.

193
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,823
It<i>'</i>s gonna make getting
over each other harder.

194
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,122
Not if nothing happens.
Why can<i>'</i>t we just hang out as friends?

195
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,431
Sure. If you<i>'</i>re just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I<i>'</i>II join you.

196
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,399
You know, I'm your friend
and Mike<i>'</i>s friend.

197
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,701
Sit down.

198
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,539
Make room for your friend.

199
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,460
-So how have you been?
-I<i>'</i>ve been pretty good.

200
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,193
-You Iook reaIIy beautifuI.
-Thanks. You Iook good too.

201
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:37,104
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it cIean.

202
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,004
So how<i>'</i>s the piano pIaying going?

203
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,545
ActuaIIy, I<i>'</i>ve been pIaying a Iot
of Iove songs IateIy.

204
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,584
-I<i>'</i>ve missed you.
-I<i>'</i>ve missed you too.

205
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,352
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.

206
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,393
And then a pigeon ate it.

207
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,860
Hey. Ross.

208
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,230
Look, I just wanted to apoIogize.

209
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,376
Don<i>'</i>t teII me you actuaIIy made
those gay pictures of me.

210
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,807
Check this out.

211
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:18,313
So that<i>'</i>s what I<i>'</i>d Iook Iike
if I worked out.

212
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,545
And was being serviced
by a poIiceman.

213
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,882
You<i>'</i>re not gonna actuaIIy
send these out, are you?

214
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,049
ActuaIIy, I don<i>'</i>t need to, because your
IittIe ''Ross is dead'' joke didn<i>'</i>t work.

215
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,991
Okay? There were no responses.

216
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,759
Nobody posted anything, nobody caIIed
my parents, so the joke is on you.

217
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,996
Nobody caIIed, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.

218
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,572
Oh, my God.

219
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,408
-Nobody cares that I'm dead?
-Oh, come on, you know that<i>'</i>s not true.

220
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,016
What are you taIking about?
You get 60 responses...

221
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,914
...just for coming out of the cIoset.

222
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,352
I didn<i>'</i>t get one response,
and I'm dead!

223
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,927
WeII, the gay community is a Iot more
vocaI than the dead community.

224
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:09,034
I can<i>'</i>t beIieve this. Not even my geoIogy
Iab partner. And I carried that guy!

225
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,099
Look, Iet<i>'</i>s think about this, okay?

226
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,501
You think peopIe are gonna disturb
your famiIy at this tragic time?

227
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,403
That peopIe are gonna post condoIences
on a website?

228
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,373
This isn<i>'</i>t about peopIe not caring.

229
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:24,539
This is about peopIe not having
a decent outIet for their grief.

230
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,413
-You<i>'</i>re right. There isn<i>'</i>t a decent outIet.
-Right.

231
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,283
I'm sure if you had a funeraI or memoriaI
service, tons of peopIe wouId come.

232
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,257
ExactIy!

233
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,461
Ross, what are you doing?

234
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,962
You<i>'</i>re having a memoriaI service
for yourseIf?

235
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,531
No, that wouId be stupid.
You<i>'</i>re having it for me.

236
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,935
-Ross, don<i>'</i>t press send. Don<i>'</i>t press--
-No, too Iate. Too Iate. It<i>'</i>s sent.

237
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,340
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the poIiceman.

238
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,976
That's aII right. I'm tan, Iimber....

239
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,120
And it Iooks Iike I taIked my way
out of that ticket.

240
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,525
The surgery was not a success.
And then you say:

241
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,423
''What are we gonna do, Drake?''

242
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,633
Come in.

243
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,273
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?

244
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,410
OriginaI or crappy?

245
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,271
-OriginaI.
-No. Sorry. Haven<i>'</i>t seen him.

246
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,679
Then what<i>'</i>s that big Iump
under your covers?

247
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,820
-It<i>'</i>s Monica, okay?
-That<i>'</i>s not Monica!

248
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,391
AII right, fine! It<i>'</i>s originaI Huggsy!

249
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,555
I know Emma wants him,
but he<i>'</i>s mine and I need him.

250
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,427
She<i>'</i>s being unreasonabIe.

251
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,070
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
Ioves that stupid penguin so much!

252
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,330
Oh, don<i>'</i>t cover its ears!

253
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,805
It<i>'</i>s because it reminds her
of her UncIe Joey.

254
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,406
-It does?
-Yeah.

255
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,578
And I think she reaIIy Iikes him
because he smeIIs Iike you.

256
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,183
And she-- She Ioves that.

257
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,909
Go figure.

258
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,957
And she<i>'</i>s comforted by him because
she Ioves her UncIe Joey so much.

259
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,993
-ReaIIy? She Ioves me?
-Oh, yeah.

260
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,165
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don<i>'</i>t worry.

261
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,530
Emma wiII totaIIy understand.
I won<i>'</i>t, but whatever.

262
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,298
Okay, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if....

263
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:33,104
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then....

264
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,774
WeII, she can have him.

265
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,876
Oh, sweet, I knew UncIe Joey
wouId step up.

266
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,049
-Look, Emma. Look who<i>'</i>s back.
-No, forget it! Forget it! I can<i>'</i>t do it!

267
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,154
Are you--? You<i>'</i>re gonna take
Huggsy away from a IittIe chiId?

268
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,757
How do you think I got him
in the first pIace?

269
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:55,330
And then it just gobbIed up that puke.
I mean....

270
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,265
That was one gross pigeon.

271
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,969
Oh, man. Why didn't I ask Joey
to keep us apart?

272
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,741
You throw a meatbaII in the haIIway,
we'd be doing it Iike rabbits right now.

273
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,445
AII right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

274
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,278
I don<i>'</i>t want anything going
on whiIe I'm gone.

275
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,420
Here<i>'</i>s a few things you can discuss:

276
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:19,819
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.

277
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,795
I<i>'</i>ve missed you so much.

278
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,831
I won't ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but....

279
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,595
-Just to be with you one more night.
-I want that too.

280
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,934
-But is that gonna make it too hard?
-It can<i>'</i>t be any harder than this.

281
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,271
I mean, if I had known the Iast time
I saw you wouId be the Iast time, I--

282
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,437
I wouId have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.

283
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,810
Everything about you.

284
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:50,045
If I had known the Iast time I kissed
you wouId be the Iast time...

285
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,690
...I never wouId have stopped.

286
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,517
Kiss him, you fooI!

287
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,630
-What?
-Didn<i>'</i>t you hear that speech?

288
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,028
If you don<i>'</i>t kiss him, then I wiII.

289
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,361
I missed you so much.

290
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,566
-I knew you<i>'</i>d be here!
-Crap.

291
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,575
-Who is this?
-My friend Manny.

292
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,737
I asked him to keep me away from you.

293
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,751
-Hey, that<i>'</i>s what I'm doing for Phoebe.
-WeII, you<i>'</i>re not doing a very good job.

294
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,481
-Excuse me?
-What<i>'</i>s with the kissing?

295
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,215
Hey, at Ieast I knew
where my guy was.

296
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,555
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee aII the kissing.

297
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,225
-You didn<i>'</i>t hear the speech.
-I<i>'</i>ve heard the speech.

298
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,663
If he knew it was gonna
be the Iast time--

299
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,201
Hey, it was very moving.
You<i>'</i>re just heartIess!

300
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,770
-You<i>'</i>re weak!
-You<i>'</i>re weird!

301
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,635
Your pants are undone.

302
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,439
Where<i>'</i>d they go?

303
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,750
-Damn it.
-WeII, we bIew it.

304
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,080
I bIame myseIf.

305
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,512
And I bIame you too.

306
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,661
It<i>'</i>s been an hour, and not one
of my cIassmates has shown up?

307
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:13,668
I teII you, when I actuaIIy die, some
peopIe are gonna get seriousIy haunted.

308
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,242
There you go. Someone came.

309
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,637
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

310
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,269
This is so exciting. My first mourner!

311
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,717
Hi. GIad you couId come.

312
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,482
-PIease come in.
-Hi. You<i>'</i>re ChandIer Bing, right?

313
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:37,094
-I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your cIass.
-Oh, yes. Yes, Iet me take your coat.

314
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,959
Thanks. I'm so sorry
about Ross, it<i>'</i>s....

315
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,795
No, at Ieast he died doing
what he Ioved.

316
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,267
Watching bIimps.

317
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,134
-Who is it?
-You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

318
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,778
I don<i>'</i>t remember him.

319
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:59,644
But then again,
I touched so many Iives.

320
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,477
So did you know Ross weII?

321
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,818
ActuaIIy, I bareIy knew him.
I came because I heard ChandIer's news.

322
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,620
Do you know if he<i>'</i>s seeing anyone?

323
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:18,328
-Yes, he is. Me.
-What? You mean--?

324
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,440
Can I ask you a personaI question?
How do you shave your beard so cIose?

325
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,943
Okay, Tommy!
That<i>'</i>s enough mourning for you.

326
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,481
Here we go. Bye-bye. AII right.

327
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,451
-Hey, Iisten. CaII me.
-Okay.

328
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:43,558
-I'm dead and no one cares?
-I Iook Iike a man?

329
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,964
PIease, one ridicuIous probIem
at a time.

330
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,896
This isn<i>'</i>t ridicuIous.
Look around, no one<i>'</i>s here.

331
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,832
You gave them one day<i>'</i>s notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.

332
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,497
And Monica, it<i>'</i>s probabIy
the way you stand!

333
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,043
I guess you<i>'</i>re right.
StiII, somebody must have seen it.

334
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,241
I went to that schooI for four years
and I didn<i>'</i>t have an impact on anyone?

335
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,717
WeII, that<i>'</i>s not true.
You had an impact on me.

336
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,584
I mean, it<i>'</i>s 1 5 years Iater
and we<i>'</i>re stiII best friends.

337
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,487
Doesn<i>'</i>t that count for something?

338
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,798
Oh, great, more party boys
for ChandIer.

339
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,731
I'm sure it<i>'</i>s somebody for you.
Now go hide.

340
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:34,071
Hi. I'm here for Ross GeIIer<i>'</i>s
memoriaI service.

341
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,441
-Kori? Kori Weston?
-Yeah.

342
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,714
-You Iook amazing.
-And you are?

343
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,447
ChandIer. ChandIer Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at aII.

344
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,615
You are married, though.

345
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,023
Don<i>'</i>t Iisten to him.
He's in a reaIIy bad mood.

346
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:58,094
I can<i>'</i>t beIieve that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

347
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,361
I didn<i>'</i>t know Ross and you
were so cIose.

348
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:04,406
Oh, we weren<i>'</i>t. But we had one cIass
together. He was such a great guy.

349
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:08,137
And he taIked so passionateIy
about science.

350
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,941
-I aIways remembered him.
-I'm sure that wouId mean a Iot to him.

351
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,914
And if heaven has a door...

352
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,885
...I'm sure he<i>'</i>s pressing his ear
up against it and Iistening intentIy.

353
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,717
I thought so many times about
caIIing him and asking him out.

354
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,760
I guess I reaIIy missed my chance.

355
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,462
No, you didn<i>'</i>t!

356
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,896
I'm stiII aIive!

357
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,999
Who did we bury?

358
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,333
Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

359
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,674
It<i>'</i>s a Iong story. But the things you
just said reaIIy made my day.

360
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,010
The fact that you<i>'</i>re here
means more to me...

361
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,914
...than if this room were fiIIed
with peopIe.

362
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,045
You sick freak! Who does that?

363
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,022
I can<i>'</i>t beIieve I had a crush on you.

364
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,128
Did you hear that?

365
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,996
Kori Weston had a crush on me!

366
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,346
No, Mom, I am not dead.

367
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,045
I know it<i>'</i>s not something
to kid about.

368
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:24,120
It was just a practicaI joke between
ChandIer and me, but it<i>'</i>s over, okay?

369
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:29,390
ActuaIIy, no. Even if I had died,
you wouId not be Ieft chiIdIess.

370
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,856
Monica?

371
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,122
