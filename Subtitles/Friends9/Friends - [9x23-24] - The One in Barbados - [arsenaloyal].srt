1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,999
Hey! I'm aII packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,336
That's right. Daddy and UncIe Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,140
We're going to a conference in Barbados.
Right? Can you say, ''Barbados''?

4
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,283
Barbados.

5
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,278
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much
to me that you guys are coming...

6
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,152
...aII the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,260
And I have a surprise.
I had to puII some strings...

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,457
...but I was abIe to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,100
These babies wiII get you into aII
the paIeontoIogy Iectures and seminars.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,375
Do you have anything
that wiII get us out of them?

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,314
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

12
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,382
...we're gonna want to do isIand stuff.

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,813
David wiII probabIy want to hear
a few Iectures.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,011
-Right, because he's a scientist.
-No, no.

15
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,953
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunIight...

16
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,821
...he'II die.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,893
-Okay, we'd better go.
-Yeah?

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,897
-So we'II see you guys tomorrow.
-AII right, Iet's do it.

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,797
A five-hour fIight with CharIie,
have a coupIe drinks...

20
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,460
...get under that bIanket
and do what comes naturaI.

21
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,869
It's a bIanket, Joe,
not a cIoak of invisibiIity.

22
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:18,159
-Wow, this pIace is beautifuI!
-Look at aII these paIeontoIogists!

23
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,604
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty foIks by the pooI tomorrow.

24
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:27,042
-My God, I can't beIieve you're here!
-I think I've been recognized.

25
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:31,411
-This happens aII the time.
-Dr. GeIIer? I am such a huge fan.

26
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,084
That never happens.

27
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,690
I've been foIIowing your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

28
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:43,261
-Wow! This is very fIattering.
-I wouId Iove your autograph.

29
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,590
WeII, sure.

30
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,598
-''Dear...?''
-Sarah.

31
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:54,070
''Sarah. I dig you.''

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,473
-''Dr. Ross GeIIer.''
-Oh, thank you so much.

33
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,911
Sure. Sarah, I'd Iike you to introduce you
to my coIIeague, Professor WheeIer.

34
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:07,075
-And this is Joey Tribbiani.
-Are you a paIeontoIogist?

35
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,718
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

36
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,724
You probabIy recognize me from a
IittIe show caIIed <i>The Days of Our Lives.</i>

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:19,957
Dude, it's just <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
There's no ''the.''

38
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:29,436
Okay, Ross. Boy, you.... Yeah.
No, no. I pIay Dr. Drake Ramoray.

39
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,343
-I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.
-You don't own a TV?

40
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,143
What's aII your furniture pointed at?

41
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,318
-WeII, it was a pIeasure to meet you aII.
-You too, Sarah.

42
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,694
Jeez, who doesn't own a TV?

43
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,260
WeII, actuaIIy, I don't.

44
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,331
Yeah, and mine broke two months ago
and I stiII haven't gotten a new one.

45
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,195
WeII, didn't you two come
to the right convention.

46
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,834
David, can you heIp me?

47
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,670
I'm trying to expIain to ChandIer
how a pIane stays in the air.

48
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,574
CertainIy. That's a combination
of BernouIIi's PrincipIe...

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,272
-...and Newton's third Iaw of motion.
-See?

50
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,909
Yeah. That's the same as,
''It has something to do with wind.''

51
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,923
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,687
I shouId go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

53
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,659
...or shouId Mike and I meet you?

54
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,402
Mike? Who's Mike?

55
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,236
-Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
-That's right!

56
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,106
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totaIIy forgotten about him.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,219
-That's a bIast from the past, huh?
-No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

58
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,115
It reaIIy doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,281
...Monica refers to ChandIer
as Richard aII the time.

60
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,228
-She does?
-Let's get you out of here.

61
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,333
WeII, at Ieast you took me down
with you.

62
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:10,008
I'm so sorry. I just--
I keep thinking about Mike.

63
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,076
I'm crazy about David, and
we're having so much fun together.

64
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,240
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just--
That's gonna go away, right?

65
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,443
-WeII, I guess. In time.
-Yeah.

66
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,555
I mean, my feeIings for Richard
are certainIy gone.

67
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:29,319
You just did it again. ChandIer. Your
feeIings for ChandIer are certainIy gone.

68
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,962
Boy, Phoebe's stiII pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

69
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,160
I wouIdn't read too much into it.

70
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,533
StiII, a girI caIIs you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

71
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,768
-...that's not a good thing, right?
-Let me stop you there.

72
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:49,607
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

73
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,611
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

74
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:58,189
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

75
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:03,594
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I couId do, you know?

76
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,466
-WeII, you know Phoebe--
-SeriousIy, we're gonna do this?

77
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,295
I'm sorry, I just wish I couId make her
forget about Mike aIready.

78
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:16,304
-Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
-Because his penis was too big.

79
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,604
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.

80
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,677
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

81
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,482
What if you Iet Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

82
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,925
That's great. That's great.
I'II propose to her.

83
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,461
What?

84
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,996
I was probabIy going to do it
at some point.

85
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,235
-No, I didn't mean now.
-WeII, why not? It's briIIiant.

86
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,236
''Goodbye, Mike.
We'II see you at the wedding, feIIa.

87
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,307
WeII, we probabIy won't invite you
to the wedding, but--''

88
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,002
-WeII, thank you, ChandIer. SincereIy.
-WeII, you're weIcome.

89
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,146
GIad I couId heIp.

90
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,881
-How do you think I shouId propose?
-I'm pretending to read here.

91
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,713
I'm sorry.

92
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,955
Yeah. How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

93
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,196
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

94
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:18,730
I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

95
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,901
You reaIIy shouId have been
more cIear about that.

96
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,412
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

97
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,847
Britney Spears!

98
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,254
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

99
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:41,015
-No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
-Oh, my God!

100
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,718
-I know!
-Did you taIk to him?

101
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,194
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

102
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,461
You couId say, ''Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?''

103
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,533
-You ready to go?
-You're gonna go now?

104
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,540
-I thought we couId hang out.
-I can't. I have seminars aII day.

105
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,837
I promised Ross
I'd Iook at his speech.

106
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:06,114
But maybe we couId have dinner Iater?
Out on the baIcony? It'II be romantic.

107
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,477
WiII you wear a thong?

108
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,416
I wiII if you wiII.

109
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,426
You got yourseIf a very weird deaI.

110
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,421
I'm good. I have dinner pIans.

111
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,925
-So you gonna be okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

112
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:27,163
I got tons of stuff I couId do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

113
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,135
Joe, have you Iooked outside?

114
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,738
No. Why?

115
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,177
-Oh, man.
-There's an indoor pooI.

116
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,578
-You couId swim there.
-Yeah.

117
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:42,278
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hoIe.

118
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,819
That Mike thing was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

119
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:54,626
-...with Phoebe and David.
-I do. Want a hint, huh?

120
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,400
I do.

121
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,137
I do.

122
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,374
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordpIay...

123
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,638
...because you are pink
with bareIy controIIed gIee.

124
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,844
-David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
-What? Why?

125
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,384
Because we were taIking about ways
he couId beat Mike...

126
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,854
...and I toId him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

127
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,125
ChandIer, we have taIked about this.

128
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,286
You are not supposed to give
peopIe advice!

129
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,792
CouIdn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

130
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,435
I did!

131
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,599
A penis one!

132
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,702
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

133
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,935
They've onIy been going out
for a few weeks.

134
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:43,581
Phoebe is compIeteIy hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'II say no...

135
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,241
...David's heart wiII be broken,
it'II be too hard for them to recover...

136
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,354
...and then Phoebe wiII end up
aIone again.

137
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,347
Man, that's some bad advice.

138
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,363
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

139
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,766
-What's going on?
-Everything is upside-down here.

140
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:12,878
It rains aII day Iong and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

141
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,744
I don't want to aIarm anybody...

142
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,443
...but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we Ianded.

143
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,320
Okay. When I go pIaces
with high humidity...

144
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,925
...it gets a IittIe extra body, okay?

145
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,291
That's why our honeymoon photos
Iook Iike me and Diana Ross.

146
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,261
I'II show you guys where to check in.

147
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,663
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

148
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:41,398
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

149
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,599
And with mirrors on the ceiIing.

150
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,508
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

151
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,946
Oh, you guys are so Iucky
you're here with peopIe.

152
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,915
I'd Iove to share this with someone.

153
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,578
Oh, honey, you have us. We Iove you.

154
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:01,921
Okay, which one of you
is gonna sIeep with me?

155
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,689
You know, it's just
such a romantic pIace.

156
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,631
I just wish I couId share it with a guy.

157
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,230
-Not Joey.
-Not Joey. No.

158
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:18,503
-I was just Iusting after ChandIer.
-Yeah, right.

159
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,581
So.... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

160
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,285
Tonight?

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,078
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

162
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,416
Oh, there it is.

163
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,925
Yes, weII, being a faiIed scientist doesn't
pay quite as weII as you might think.

164
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,357
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

165
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,438
And the cIarity is quite poor.

166
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,069
Nice.

167
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,604
-Monica, can I taIk to you for a second?
-Okay.

168
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,610
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

169
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,750
See what happens
when you give peopIe advice?

170
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,547
-WeII, I hope you toId him not to.
-That wouId be advice!

171
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,651
Okay, fine. I'II handIe this.

172
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,229
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

173
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,896
-I need to taIk to you.
-Are you Ieaving the Supremes?

174
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:28,536
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

175
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,909
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

176
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,576
Wow, reaIIy?

177
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,614
That's fantastic!

178
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,358
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

179
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,519
-What about Mike?
-Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

180
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,925
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

181
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,431
...and force him down the aisIe, okay?

182
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,298
I can just see it.
''Mike, do you take Phoebe?''

183
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,466
You know? It's every girI's dream.

184
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,137
Do you reaIIy think marrying
someone eIse is the right answer?

185
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,614
Sure. Look, okay, bottom Iine?
I Iove Mike-- David!

186
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,387
David! I Iove David.

187
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,548
Don't Iook at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

188
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:22,462
''By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very reaI way...

189
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,265
...bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century.''

190
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,665
It's great.

191
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah, you reaIIy think so?

192
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,609
You'II be the hit
of the conference.

193
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,372
It'II be even better tomorrow...

194
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,177
...because I won't be constantIy
interrupted by Joey...

195
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,286
...checking to see if they put
chocoIates on my piIIow yet.

196
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,618
-Hey, guys.
-The chocoIates aren't here.

197
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,728
Damn it!

198
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,194
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

199
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,698
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd Iove to give it a read.

200
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,838
If you want to check your e-maiI,
just ask.

201
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,166
What? May I?

202
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,814
What's with the rain, GeIIer? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

203
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,883
...nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

204
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,680
-The wet season is June to December.
-It's not the time, CharIie.

205
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,424
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

206
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,824
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

207
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,034
Secret teapot.

208
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,662
Your computer. I don't know what--
Everything's gone.

209
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,931
-What do you mean?
-Must be a virus.

210
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,075
I think it erased your hard drive.

211
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,575
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

212
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,111
Someone I don't know sent me an e-maiI
and I opened it.

213
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,047
-Why? Why wouId you open it?
-WeII, it didn't say, ''This is a virus.''

214
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,055
-What did it say?
-''Nude--''

215
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,692
''Pictures of Anna Kournikova.''

216
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,295
-I'm so sorry.
-What am I gonna do?

217
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,557
-My speech is gone!
-It's not gone.

218
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,293
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

219
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,232
No, I don't!

220
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,941
WeII, you must be pretty mad
at yourseIf right now.

221
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,784
-It's reaIIy gone?
-Yep.

222
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,890
I'd Iike to thank you guys
for coming down here...

223
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,891
...to compIain about the rain
and ruin my career.

224
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,961
-I just feeI awfuI.
-Yeah, you shouId.

225
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:36,294
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's
never even won a major tournament.

226
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,400
WeII, I tried BiIIie Jean King, but--

227
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,806
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kiII-you Iook.

228
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,209
I can usuaIIy make it go away
by kissing her.

229
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,046
Get out.

230
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,983
You know, this happens aII the time
to my computer at work.

231
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,984
-What do you do?
-I usuaIIy go...

232
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,387
...pIay Tetris on somebody eIse's
computer.

233
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,223
I can't beIieve this is happening.

234
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,954
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

235
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,862
I have to stand up in front of aII
these peopIe. What am I gonna say?

236
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,160
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

237
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:17,134
I don't think your monoIogue from
<i>Star Wars</i> is gonna heIp me right now.

238
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,470
Ross, we can soIve this.
I just heard your speech.

239
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,447
-We can re-create it. We've got aII night.
-What, you reaIIy think we can do that?

240
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:28,882
Oh, wait. Joey and I
are supposed to have dinner.

241
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,488
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

242
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,457
RacheI and I wiII stay and heIp
any way we can.

243
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,792
AII right. Okay, Iet's do it.

244
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,602
WeII, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

245
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,330
And then I move on to what is cIearIy
the defining moment...

246
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,069
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. HeIIo?

247
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,409
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

248
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,610
Any chance any of this happened
in a gaIaxy far, far away?

249
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,657
-HeIIo?
-<i>Okay, Mike?</i>

250
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,458
Enough is enough.
You Iove Phoebe, and she Ioves you.

251
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,227
So get over your
I-never-wanna-get-married thing...

252
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,802
...and step up!

253
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,895
Who is this?

254
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,337
<i>This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.</i>

255
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,377
Sure, Monica.
So good to have you back in my Iife.

256
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,371
Listen, Phoebe is back with David.

257
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,710
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

258
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,183
...but I know she reaIIy wants to be
with you.

259
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,353
He's gonna propose?

260
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,986
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through aII this damned hair!

261
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,363
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she shouId.

262
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,435
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither shouId you.

263
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,366
You don't teII me what to do.
I teII you what to do.

264
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,699
Just caII her. She's at the Paradise HoteI
in Barbados.

265
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,107
And whiIe I've got you,
you've got curIy hair.

266
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,213
What do you do in the humidity?

267
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,213
Damn it!

268
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,450
-WeII, I hope you're happy.
-I hope you're happy too, honey.

269
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,287
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

270
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,193
-That's what happens when you meddIe.
-Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

271
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,835
No, it's not.
She's stiII in Iove with Mike.

272
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,301
-There's no chance that wiII work?
-No, I caIIed.

273
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,909
-It's not gonna happen.
-MeddIer! MeddIer!

274
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,311
If you hadn't meddIed to start with...

275
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,141
...then I wouIdn't have had to go in
and meddIe myseIf.

276
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,409
No matter how much we meddIe,
we'II never be abIe to unmeddIe...

277
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,452
...the thing that you meddIed up
in the first pIace!

278
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,950
This vacation sucks!

279
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,163
I'm so bored.

280
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,126
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

281
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,965
WeII, I brought some books.
We couId read.

282
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,141
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

283
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,209
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

284
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,541
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceuticaI convention.

285
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,019
You feeI Iike going to a convention?

286
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,555
-We can't. We're not pharmacists.
-I know we're not...

287
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:24,685
...but Frank Madaio and Eva....

288
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,896
-Kate MiIIer.
-Kate MiIIer it is.

289
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,833
-Okay.
-Oh, good--

290
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,669
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

291
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,870
WeII, in that case,
shouId I make sure it's on reaI good?

292
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,443
Thank you.

293
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,521
So, Kate...

294
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,390
...how's the pharmacy game treating you?

295
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,464
WeII, Frank, I teII you, it's rough.

296
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:05,296
I mean, is it me or is doctors' handwriting
getting harder and harder to read?

297
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,267
I know, I know.

298
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,132
I teII you.

299
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,277
But on the pIus side,
we get to wear those white coats...

300
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:16,437
-...and stand behind that reaIIy taII counter.
-Oh, that's true.

301
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,986
You're Joey Tribbiani
from <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

302
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,955
FinaIIy, someone recognizes me. Okay.

303
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,821
And it's <i>The Days of Our Lives.</i>

304
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,459
-Jackie, it is him.
-Yeah, Jackie, it's me. Come on over.

305
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,296
Oh, my God, this is so exciting!

306
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,801
So why are you here?

307
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:44,432
I'm doing research for a roIe
in a new movie about pharmacists.

308
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,511
Yeah, it's caIIed <i>Prescription for Love.</i>

309
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,541
-Nice.
-Yeah.

310
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,682
This is my friend RacheI.
She's in the movie too.

311
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,117
I'm an actress.

312
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,020
So, what's the movie about?

313
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,094
WeII, I pIay the handsome,
macho pharmacist...

314
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,959
...and RacheI is my student...

315
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,794
...who wants to Iearn aII about...

316
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,765
...pharmacing.

317
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,395
And, see, I'm shy at first...

318
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:19,510
...but then, I take off my gIasses
and become sexy, you know.

319
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:24,843
And there's some nudity,
but it's very tastefuIIy done.

320
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,952
My nudity in the fiIm
is not tastefuI at aII.

321
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,182
So you're doing research?

322
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,019
-Do you have any questions for us?
-I sure do.

323
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,629
Where'd that guy get the big, pink drink?

324
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,863
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

325
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,164
...into the 21 st century.

326
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,133
WeII, yeah. That's it?

327
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,034
That's it. That's the whoIe speech.

328
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,678
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. We did it.

329
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:59,681
ActuaIIy, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingIy IittIe of your own speech.

330
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,254
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

331
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,523
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

332
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,655
That's a pretty neckIace.

333
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,567
Thank you.

334
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,071
Hey, what do you say we ceIebrate?
Champagne?

335
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,370
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fiII the bottIe with water...

336
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,911
...and put it back so they
don't charge you.

337
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,051
Oh, my God, I Iove you.

338
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,249
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

339
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,221
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

340
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,152
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

341
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,854
-Your first marriage?
-Yeah.

342
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,500
You've been married more than once?

343
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,293
No.

344
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,269
So why'd you break up?

345
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,644
Oh, it was--

346
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:06,147
It's compIicated, you know?
She was...

347
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,483
...gay.

348
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,249
ActuaIIy, it's not that compIicated.

349
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,948
Oh, my God.

350
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,650
This is so cooI!

351
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,489
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

352
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,121
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

353
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,234
Hey! High-five!

354
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,772
Didn't you feeI so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

355
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,340
My fiancé was aIways going on
Iong weekends with his ''tennis partner.''

356
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:37,038
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

357
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,706
She didn't get any fitter.

358
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,853
-Everybody's Iike, ''I knew aII aIong.''
-I know.

359
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,615
If you knew, why didn't you teII me?
I mean, caII, Ieave a note.

360
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,784
''Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay.''

361
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,460
-I know.
-And then--

362
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,460
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

363
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,567
...so you fIoat the idea of a threesome.

364
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,170
I didn't do that.

365
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,867
Me neither.

366
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,209
WeII, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

367
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,475
I know. That oId Iady at the end
was ready to take you home.

368
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,778
Not enough piIIs in the worId, Rach.

369
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,919
What about you, huh? You're the singIe
one. See anybody in there you Iike?

370
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,927
WeII, Iet's see. There was that
reaIIy big guy that I was taIking to...

371
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,930
...with the reaIIy nice breasts.

372
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,901
But what about back home? Anything
going on there? Anybody you Iike?

373
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,472
No.

374
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,908
-There is. You're bIushing.
-No, I'm not bIushing...

375
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,948
...and I'm sunburned.

376
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,413
From, you know, the rain.

377
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,453
You Iike someone. TeII me who.

378
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,922
-TeII me who it is. Come on.
-No. Joey.

379
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,755
Who do you Iike?
You're not getting away that easy.

380
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,726
-Who do you Iike?
-Joey, come on!

381
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:04,460
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not Iike anything's gonna happen.

382
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:09,039
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

383
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,579
Okay. Okay.
You reaIIy want to know who it is?

384
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,581
-Yeah. Who is it?
-Do you?

385
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,547
-Oh, hey.
-I just Ieft you a message.

386
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,782
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

387
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,587
...but now that you're here,
we couId have that dinner.

388
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,492
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

389
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,133
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

390
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,236
-I had a great time.
-Yeah.

391
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,803
This isn't over,
because I reaIIy want to know--

392
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,440
Later. Later.

393
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,503
-So shaII we?
-Yeah.

394
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,607
-Okay.
-Good night.

395
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,871
Good night.

396
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,586
-Okay, good night.
-Good night, Ross.

397
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:12,098
I can't beIieve she's gonna
say yes to David.

398
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,397
She's cIearIy in Iove with Mike.

399
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,439
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriousIy when you Iook Iike that.

400
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,544
CouId we have a bottIe
of champagne, pIease?

401
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,446
And I'm kind of on a budget,
so if you have anything IocaI...

402
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,951
...or Canadian.

403
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:39,020
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.

404
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,994
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

405
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,668
I think we have time.
Have you heard him taIk?

406
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:49,967
''Phoebe, I wouId be honored if--''
Spit it out, David!

407
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,340
Phoebe.

408
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:03,185
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearabIe.

409
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,813
Of course, the sanitation strikes
in Minsk didn't heIp.

410
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,690
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

411
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,992
But, weII, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

412
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:19,193
So to that end....

413
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,935
-Oh, my God, Mike.
-It's David, actuaIIy.

414
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,042
No, Mike's here.

415
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,841
Oh, hey, Mike.

416
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,347
Hi, David.

417
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,879
ChandIer. Monic-- Oh!

418
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,556
It's the humidity!

419
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,963
-Hi, Phoebe.
-What are you doing here?

420
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,704
I have a question I need to ask you.

421
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,602
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myseIf.

422
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:02,142
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she reaIIy needs to hear this.

423
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,812
Okay.

424
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,045
-WouId you care for my seat as weII?
-ActuaIIy, yeah, that'd be great.

425
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,549
WeII, that's fair, you've had a Iong trip.

426
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,928
Phoebe, I Iove you.

427
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,902
I've missed you so much
these Iast few months.

428
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,406
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

429
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,068
...but I reaIized that there was
no reason good enough...

430
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,773
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my Iife with you.

431
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,753
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

432
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,717
I'm sorry, David,
but she reaIIy has to know this.

433
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,191
AII right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

434
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,624
If it stops raining.

435
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,998
You're the most incredibIe woman
I've ever met.

436
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:06,476
How couId I Iose you?
Now, I don't actuaIIy have a ring.

437
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:10,011
-I have a ring.
-I wouIdn't brag about that, big guy.

438
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,251
But, Phoebe...

439
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,577
...wiII you marry me?

440
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,449
No.

441
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:34,530
I Iove you, but I never needed
a proposaI from you.

442
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,207
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

443
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,402
-That we had a future.
-We can have any future you want.

444
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,213
Okay, weII, I'm gonna take off.

445
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,185
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

446
00:29:56,361 --> 00:30:00,388
Just so I know, if I had asked first...?

447
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:06,127
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that wouId've been wrong.

448
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,197
PIease, you don't have to expIain.

449
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,275
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

450
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:17,403
...things wouId have worked out for us,
and I wouIdn't have ruined my career.

451
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,813
Or Iost that toe to frostbite.

452
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:22,910
It was a good trip.

453
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,451
-Is it okay if I hug you now?
-Oh, yes.

454
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:38,094
Because of our meddIing! AII right?

455
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,875
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I couId just Iie here aII day.

456
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,312
Oh, I know.

457
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:58,478
-Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
-So gIad we got adjoining rooms.

458
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:04,253
-The sun is out!
-Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

459
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,952
Go to the pooI and reserve chairs.

460
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:10,666
-I wiII get the magazines and the Iotion.
-Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

461
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,735
-No!
-Damn it!

462
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,400
WaIIs are pretty thin, guys.

463
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,108
''Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

464
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,252
...which caII into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating.''

465
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:37,222
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pooI getting tan.

466
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,092
She's aII Ieathery and wrinkIed.
I'm so jeaIous!

467

''FinaIIy, factor in the profusion

''And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

471

472
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,278
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebraI deveIopment.''

-What?
-He said ''<i>erectus.</i>''

I thought it was wonderfuI.
Jarvis OberbIau. CorneII.

486
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:17,491
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and....

487
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,826
Okay, now we're just hoIding hands.

488
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:30,005
AIrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was reaIIy great.

489
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,836
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

490
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,212
-Take it easy.
-AII right, thanks. Thanks so much.

491
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,010
I can't teII you how much it means
that you were here.

492
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,118
You kidding?
We wouIdn't have missed it.

493
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,415
I'm back.

494
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,357
Okay. WeII, excuse me?

495
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,326
-WeII?
-You were incredibIe.

496
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,899
You bIew them away.

497
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,003
I can't teII you how great it was
to Iook in the crowd and see your face.

498
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,767
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words aIong with me?

499
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,567
-I was not.
-No, it's okay.

500
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,747
It made me feeI Iike a rock star.

501
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,141
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

502
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,419
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hoteI room.

503
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,751
Look, I took it too far.

504
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,293
Hey, I thought you were
going to the beach.

505
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,027
-It's raining again.
-What?

506
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,830
WouId you Iook at that.

507
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,599
The onIy time the sun comes out
the whoIe weekend...

508
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,834
...is the one hour I'm giving my speech.

509
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,104
Someone up there Iikes me.

510
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,950
But peopIe down here are pissed.

511
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,817
I can't beIieve it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

512
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,792
WeII, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

513
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,422
...aII these paIeontoIogists
with their shirts off.

514
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,700
Not you guys.

515
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,667
You've got it going on.

516
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,774
-What wiII we do today?
-They have a game room downstairs.

517
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,472
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

518
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,548
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

519
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,118
-Let's pIay.
-I don't think so.

520
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,616
-Why not?
-You know how competitive you get.

521
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,885
And whiIe I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm Iying.

522
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,426
-I'm not aIways that bad.
-Oh, yeah?

523
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,033
What happened when we pIayed
Iast time?

524
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,601
I punched you.

525
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,602
-And?
-Phoebe.

526
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,843
-And?
-I cIunked your heads together.

527
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,864
-There you are.
-Hey. Listen.

528
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,661
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeIing.

529
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,566
Some kid toId me about this sea turtIe.
If you bIow bubbIes in his face...

530
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,140
...he chases you.

531
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,779
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group aII afternoon.

532
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,575
That's okay.
I'II find someone eIse to do it.

533
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,580
I'd do it aIone, but...

534
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,244
...I don't know what happens
if the sea turtIe catches you.

535
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,115
You know, I feeI so bad.

536
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,193
I haven't seen you this whoIe trip.
EspeciaIIy Iast night--

537
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,797
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with RacheI.

538
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,924
I just feIt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

539
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,196
ActuaIIy, it turned out to be a Iot of fun.

540
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,875
Oh, weII, at Ieast
we're both having fun, right?

541
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,180
-Is it weird that it's not with each other?
-Yeah.

542
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,043
A IittIe bit, yeah.

543
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,187
I think we need to taIk.

544
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,125
Yeah, I think we do.

545
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,397
About what?

546
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,268
-Come on, you guys, it'II be fun!
-AII right.

547
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:24,204
-I'II pIay if we don't keep score.
-WeII, then how do we know who wins?

548
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:30,039
-Nobody wins.
-So we're just four Iosers. Super.

549
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,607
-WeII, I'm not pIaying with her.
-I'm out.

550
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,684
-I'II pIay you.
-Okay.

551
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,413
-You don't know what you're doing.
-She gets crazy.

552
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,217
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

553
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,886
I think I'II be aII right.

554
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,896
-You want to voIIey a bit for serve?
-Sure, if you want to.

555
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,442
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

556
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,242
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

557
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,015
-You ready to pIay?
-HeII, yeah.

558
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,984
-Did you know this about him?
-No idea. I thought he was soft Iike you.

559
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,018
-Want to make it more interesting?
-How much you thinking?

560
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,022
-Ten bucks a game?
-Make it 50.

561
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,819
-I'II make it 1 00.
-One thousand--

562
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,964
Okay!

563
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,157
We'II fIip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

564
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,335
No. Either of you girIs got a quarter?

565
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,131
Honey, try to focus the trash taIk
on him.

566
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,775
-Monica, you caII it.
-Heads. No, taiIs! Heads!

567
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,380
-TaiIs.
-Oh, what are the chances?

568
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,284
-My point!
-Oh, no, I don't think so.

569
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,186
Standard ruIes: If at any time a pIayer
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

570
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,386
...to touch the pIaying surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

571
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,891
He was a Iawyer.

572
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,068
<i>All the East Coast</i>

<i>In New York, it's 7 2 and sunny.</i>

574
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,977
Weather bitch.

575
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,807
It's open.

576
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,550
-Hi, Joe.
-Hey.

577
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,987
-What? Is everything okay?
-CharIie and I broke up.

578
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,248
No. Why?

579
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,221
WeII, she said
we have nothing in common.

580
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,361
That's crazy.

581
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,160
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

582
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,497
-Yeah, that's true.
-Yeah.

583
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,694
I mean, she shouId be with someone
more Iike Ross.

584
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,171
You know, I mean he uses
aII those big words too.

585

-Man, smart peopIe are duII.
-WeII, hey!

586
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,743
Okay, Rach.

587
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:51,788
I feeI so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girIs?

588
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,616
-What are you taIking about?
-Oh, come on.

589
00:39:54,792 --> 00:40:00,230
I mean, there's you, then there's CharIie.
It's Iike.... What the heII's my probIem?

590
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,525
I just....

591
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:12,275
Okay. Maybe you're not
aIways going after the wrong girI.

592
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,536
I'm teIIing you, Rach,
CharIie is not right for me.

593
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,738
-I'm not taIking about her.
-WeII, then, who?

594
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,680
The waitress I went out with Iast month?

595
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,046
-You know what? Forget it.
-No, no, no, no.

596
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,588
-Who are you taIking about?
-No, I don't--

597
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,625
I actuaIIy don't know who
I'm taIking about, so....

598
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,120
-Okay.
-Yeah.

599
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:36,198
WeII, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

600
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,097
-And I'II see you Iater.
-Yeah, sure. Okay.

601
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,184
-You Iike me?
-Okay.

602
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,490
-Let's not make a big thing about this.
-It's a huge thing!

603
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,860
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

604
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:16,502
Look, here's the thing.
LateIy, I have been having thoughts.

605
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,001
Musings, if you wiII.

606
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,778
-WeII, for how Iong?
-Oh, onIy Iike a month.

607
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,674
-A month?
-WeII--

608
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:30,377
DiaI it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

609
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,024
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

610
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,088
-Okay, diaI it up a IittIe.
-Oh, you're right. Okay.

611
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:40,787
-I just have a question.
-Shoot.

612
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,432
-What the heII are you doing?
-I'm not trying to do anything.

613
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,935
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

614
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:52,371
And I mean, aren't you just
a IittIe curious what it wouId be Iike?

615
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,512
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

616
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,109
...George!

617
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,116
-Who?
-Curious George!

618
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,051
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yeIIow hat.

619
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,657
-Of course. I remember.
-He had a paper route.

620
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,657
Yeah, he did.

621
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,331
-See, this is what I'm taIking about.
-No, I know. We're great!

622
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,262
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

623
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,404
Can't it just happen a IittIe bit?

624
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,939
-No! It can't happen at aII!
-Why not?

625
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,808
Because, Iook, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

626
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:34,417
I have gone over this moment
in my head 1 00 times...

627
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,952
...and not once did I ever say no.

628
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,617
I couIdn't do it to Ross.

629
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,291
-But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
-I know. I know...

630
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:53,994
...but I've thought about it a Iot
since then, and it just wouIdn't be right.

631
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,273
I'm sorry.

632
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,279
I'm sorry too.

633
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,016
-Oh, God, I shouIdn't have said anything.
-No, no.

634
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,209
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'II be fine.

635
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,116
-Like you said, it's no big deaI.
-It's not a big deaI.

636
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,291
-No big deaI.
-It's so not a big deaI.

637
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:17,858
-I'II see you Iater. AII right, hey.
-Okay, great.

638
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,406
Okay--

639
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:56,399
Oh, I'm sorry, I think--
I think that may have missed the tabIe.

640
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,328
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah.

641
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,661
-Do you?
-Yeah.

642
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,667
-Do you?
-Yeah!

643
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,805
-You reaIIy find this attractive on him?
-Oh, yeah.

644
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,912
Are you teIIing me you're not even
a IittIe turned on by Monica right now?

645
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,247
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've feIt Iike the more attractive one.

646
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,424
AII right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

647
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,129
Knock that dog off her head.

648
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,134
-Damn it!
-I sIeep with him!

649
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,504
-Game point.
-Don't get too cocky.

650
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,198
Remember, I won the Iast one.

651
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,503
Oh, by the way,
how did that feeI, Iosing to a girI?

652
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,647
You shouId Iook in the mirror
before you caII yourseIf that.

653
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,511
-No! No! No!
-And that's how it's done.

654
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,419
Okey-dokey.

655
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:58,617
You've each won a game, and I've Iost
what's feIt Iike a year of my Iife.

656
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,696
Everybody goes home a winner.

657
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,661
-Best of three?
-That's what I'm thinking.

658
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:07,803
ShouId I use my invisibiIity
to fight crime or for eviI?

659
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,406
-Serve the baII, chump.
-''Serve the baII, chump.''

660
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,271
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

661
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,673
I got it!

662
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,451
I'm fine, by the way!

663
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,753
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

664
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,919
If you ever want to get away
from the city, weII, that'd be...

665
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,793
...just nifty.

666
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:43,773
WeII, I've kind of got a Iot
on my pIate right now.

667
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:48,344
Not that I wouIdn't Iove a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

668
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,080
-Jarvis?
-Oh, you're back.

669
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:58,345
-This is my wife, Nancy.
-WeII, get out!

670
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,120
-Ross? Can I taIk to you for a minute?
-Yes, pIease.

671
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,926
Is he stiII Iooking at me?

672
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,465
Yes.

673
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,630
-StiII?
-Yes.

674
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,240
And his wife's kind of Iooking at me.

675
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,377
So, what's going on?

676
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,184
WeII, Joey and I broke up.

677
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:35,057
-Oh, my God. What happened?
-Joey is a great guy...

678
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,785
...but we're just--
We're so different.

679
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,294
I mean, Iike, during your speech,
he kept Iaughing at ''<i>Homo erectus.</i>''

680
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,966
I knew that was him!

681
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:49,528
Anyway, I just....
I think it's for the best.

682
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:54,802
-Hey. Hey, you okay?
-I guess.

683
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,174
There was....

684
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:05,315
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

685
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:11,955
I started to reaIize that I was
having feeIings for someone eIse.

686
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,128
Okay, GeIIer.
Last day of the conference.

687
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,631
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

688
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,828
Professor KIarik, we're in the middIe
of a conversation here.

689
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:26,442
-Can't you throw him in the pooI Iater?
-Or we couId throw you both in now.

690
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:30,079
Okay, gentIemen, pIease.
Aren't we a IittIe oId for this?

691
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,909
I mean, we're scientists, aII right?
We're academics...

692
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:37,179
...and most importantIy,
you wiII have to catch us first.

693
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,515
Go! Go! Go!

694
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,233
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41 .

695
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,133
-Okay, Iook, enough is enough.
-No.

696
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,333
-I just have two more points to beat him.
-Monica, that was aIso true an hour ago!

697
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,102
I mean, pIease, Iook at you.

698
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,772
Your hand is bIistered, you can
bareIy stand, your hair is inexpIicabIe!

699
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,619
Pheebs, taIk to Mike. HeIp me out.

700
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:15,281
Mike, you win this, you wiII get the best sex
you've ever had in your whoIe Iife.

701
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,121
I say to fight crime.

702
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,669
You didn't see us!

703
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,674
Monica?

704
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,815
You've aIready proven
you're just as good as he is.

705
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,976
We missed our dinner reservations,
so Iet's just go upstairs...

706
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,180
...order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

707
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,052
I can't just waIk away.
I've put in four hours.

708
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,722
You knew this about me
when you married me.

709
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,867
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in heaIth.

710
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,560
WeII, this is my sickness!

711
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,433
-What about the obsessive cIeaning?
-That's just good sense.

712
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,214
-You okay?
-No, honey, I'm okay.

713
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,354
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

714
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,419
Oh, my God. I can't pIay.

715
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,063
-So you forfeit?
-Mike wins?

716
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:32,468
I can't beIieve it. I Iost.

717
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,197
-No, you didn't.
-What?

718
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,537
-Because I'm gonna pIay for you.
-You can't do that.

719
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,045
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

720
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:50,651
Okay, we're taking
that paddIe home, mister.

721
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,625
-Honey, you don't have to do this.
-Yes, I do.

722
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,124
I may not understand why
you have to win so badIy...

723
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,890
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

724
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,726
Because I Iove you.

725
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:08,161
But you suck.

726
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,306
You're weIcome, sweetheart.

727
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,675
AII right, Iet's get this over with.
Sudden death.

728
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,780
-Whoever wins this point, wins.
-Okay.

729
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:27,447
-Oh, my God. You're good.
-It's Iike watching porn.

730
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,893
And that's how it's done.

731
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:41,259
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

732
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,269
WeII, when did you--?

733
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,604
HoId on, I aImost forgot. Loser.

734
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,713
-When did you stop sucking?
-I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

735
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,942
-...to know how good I was.
-Why?

736
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,110
-I don't know.
-WeII, this is so great.

737
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,950
-Now we can enter doubIes tournaments.
-That's why.

738
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,497
-They stiII Iooking for us?
-Yeah.

739
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,502
The bartender said they spIit up
into two search parties.

740
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,140
The herbivores and the carnivores.

741
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,912
You know, we, as a group,
are not the cooIest.

742
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,980
Oh, Iook out.

743
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,517
-I don't think they saw us.
-I don't think they did.

744
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:37,456
You know, for a bunch of researchers,
they sure don't Iook very carefuIIy.

745
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,593
So I started to teII you something earIier.

746
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:53,934
There was another reason that I reaIized
it was time to end it with Joey.

747
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:59,276
I kind of reaIized I was starting
to have feeIings...

748
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,644
...for someone eIse.

749
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,380
And can I ask who?

750
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,618
I think you know.

751
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:17,293
I think I know too, but I've been reaIIy
wrong about this stuff in the past, so....

752
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:40,147
-I'm sorry, we can't.
-AII right. AII right.

753
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,986
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

754
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:47,925
I just think it wouId be a reaIIy,
reaIIy bad idea.

755
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,560
Or not. I mean--

756
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:33,133
What?

757
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,518
