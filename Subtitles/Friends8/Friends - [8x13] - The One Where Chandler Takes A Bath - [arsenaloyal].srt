1
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:09,919
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:15,758
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

3
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:20,388
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

4
00:00:22,974 --> 00:00:27,437
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

5
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:33,317
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

6
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:39,574
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

7
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:26,537
Are you..? Are you high?

8
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,874
I just had the most amazing bath.

9
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:33,461
-Really? I don't like baths.
-You like them with me.

10
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:37,006
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

11
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:42,553
-Baths are so relaxing.
-Really? What do you do?

12
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:46,098
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

13
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,353
How dirty do you think I am?

14
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:55,191
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you would love it.

15
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,527
It would take all of your stress away.

16
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,238
It's 2:00 on a Wednesday
and I'm watching Road Rules.

17
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,615
How stressed do you think I am?

18
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,539
Hey, Chandler. You got a minute?
I really need to talk to you.

19
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:14,168
Oh, yeah. Is this a cold-pizza talk
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

20
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,586
Well, neither.

21
00:02:16,546 --> 00:02:18,923
Oh, my God, what's up?

22
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,635
I don't know. It's just..

23
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,138
Lately, I've been feeling..

24
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:29,725
Okay, here's what it is.

25
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,566
You know what?
I feel a lot better. Thanks.

26
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:40,027
No. Come back here and talk to me,
mon frere.

27
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,530
-Who?
-Just come back.

28
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,949
Okay.

29
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,495
You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

30
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:54,208
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

31
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,379
But that's different. There are rules
there too, you know what I mean?

32
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,548
Do you?

33
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:08,347
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place, right?

34
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:09,724
-In London?
-Yeah.

35
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:13,477
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

36
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,023
You know what. This is a bad idea.
Forget all about it.

37
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,484
And listen, do me a favor,
this conversation between you and me.

38
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,237
If that.

39
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,996
How do I keep losing at tic-tac-toe?

40
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:35,082
Oh, no, no, honey.
My circle always stays in the middle.

41
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:40,630
Oh, Ross, don't forget we have
that doctor's appointment tomorrow.

42
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:44,008
-To find out the sex of the baby?
-No. We don't wanna know.

43
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,594
All we care about
is that it's happy and healthy.

44
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,055
Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.

45
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,016
-And smart. With an aptitude for science.
-Popular.

46
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,226
Are you two talking
about the same baby?

47
00:03:56,354 --> 00:04:00,441
-Hey, have you thought of names?
-Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

48
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,693
-Really? Me too.
-Me too.

49
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,071
Really?

50
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:10,242
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

51
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:17,083
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

52
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,585
-Rach, what were you thinking?
-Okay.

53
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,755
I was thinking if it's a girl..

54
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:27,343
how about Sandrene? It's French.

55
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:31,764
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

56
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:38,437
-Okay, fine. What do you have?
-It's for a boy.

57
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,023
I know it's a little out there, but..

58
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,985
Darwin.

59
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:48,864
Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten
to death in the schoolyard.

60
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:50,950
Yeah, by Sandrene.

61
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:54,620
You're saying that
because I said no to your name.

62
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,081
I'm really, really not.

63
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,709
How about you each get five vetoes?

64
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:04,296
-That sounds fair.
-I don't think you'll need it. Check this out.

65
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:07,967
If it's a girl, Rain.

66
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:12,013
-Veto.
-Why?

67
00:05:12,263 --> 00:05:15,641
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

68
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:20,479
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

69
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:24,275
I know her!

70
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,069
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

71
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,244
-Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
-Why do you hate our child?

72
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,414
-Fine, you go.
-Okay. James.

73
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,043
-But only if it's a girl.
-Veto.

74
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,795
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

75
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:48,174
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

76
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,179
-How about Dayton?
-Veto. Stewart.

77
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:55,055
Veto. Sawyer.

78
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:57,600
-Veto. Helen.
-Veto.

79
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:00,895
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

80
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,487
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

81
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,572
Sex on the balcony?

82
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:15,242
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

83
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,204
-What is it?
-I drew you a bath.

84
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:22,374
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of us having sex on the balcony?

85
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,420
Please. Will you just try it for me.
I used all my best stuff.

86
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,967
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

87
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:37,389
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

88
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,813
-This does butch it up a bit.
-I swear, if you try it, you will love it.

89
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:47,107
If I do this, can we at least discuss
sex on the balcony?

90
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,609
Absolutely.

91
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,822
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

92
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:07,920
All right, this isn't so bad.
I like the flowery smell.

93
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,757
Which is okay,
because I've got my boat.

94
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:17,721
I can actually feel my tension
just melting away.

95
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:19,974
I could fall asleep in here.

96
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,560
I could drown in here.

97
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,230
Drowning.

98
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,069
-So?
-Oh, my God.

99
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,782
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

100
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:39,952
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

101
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,548
I don't think you had an open mind
about the name Ruth.

102
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:56,010
I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller?
How cute is that?

103
00:07:56,218 --> 00:08:00,431
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

104
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,062
Okay. All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in knowing the sex of the baby?

105
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:11,317
-No, we're not.
-But you have it right there in that file?

106
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,694
You could tell us
whether it's a boy or a girl?

107
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,281
Dayton or Sandrene?
Phoebe or Pheebo?

108
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,950
That's right.
But if you don't wanna know..

109
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:23,913
-No, we wanna wait. Right?
-Right. Right.

110
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:27,333
Oh, I'll be right back.

111
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,628
I know it's really not my place..

112
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:34,298
but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

113
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:42,681
So which of these babies
do you think is the ugliest?

114
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,851
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

115
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,938
They're babies.
They're all beautiful.

116
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:52,566
-Third one from the left?
-Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

117
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:59,657
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you..? You're looking!

118
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,325
-I didn't!
-I saw you!

119
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:04,036
Fine, I did,
but I didn't see anything.

120
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,831
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

121
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:12,544
-Okay. But listen to me, I didn't..
-Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

122
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:15,297
I couldn't even if I wanted to,
because I don't know!

123
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:20,386
I swear I didn't see anything! I don't want
to know. It was just a momentary lapse.

124
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:23,722
Momentary lapse?
Don't you have any self-control?

125
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:27,309
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

126
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,232
Hello?

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,403
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
I think there's something wrong.

128
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:40,739
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

129
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:43,701
I'm in the bathtub.

130
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:50,916
-What's wrong?
-I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.

131
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,796
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
and is now lodged places.

132
00:09:57,006 --> 00:10:01,969
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?

133
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:05,681
-What?
-Bath salts.

134
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,267
They're starting to effervesce.

135
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,853
It's different.

136
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,023
It's interesting.

137
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,192
Okay. Let's talk about something else.

138
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:21,280
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

139
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:26,785
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

140
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:30,581
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

141
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,877
-I had the same conversation.
-You did? What was he talking about?

142
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:39,506
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since we saw him in Macbeth.

143
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,968
That was a long night.

144
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:47,473
All right, let's break this down.
What exactly did he say to you?

145
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:52,811
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

146
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,314
-He didn't say that to me.
-What'd he tell you?

147
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:58,650
He was asking questions
about you, me and London.

148
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:02,362
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

149
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,201
Okay. So you, me and London.

150
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,661
Looking at people differently.

151
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:14,041
Maybe he wants to do what you and I
did in London with someone.

152
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,584
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

153
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:20,589
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

154
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,968
-Because he was looking at her differently.
-And Phoebe is his friend.

155
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,304
So he thinks that would be
breaking the rules.

156
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:30,766
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

157
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:34,269
-You guys?
-Just a minute!

158
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,816
-That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
-You don't say anything.

159
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,026
Why would I say anything?

160
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:44,738
That two of our friends could start
the greatest love affair of their lives?

161
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,617
They would have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

162
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,996
-I'm not gonna let you say anything.
-You just stay here.

163
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,374
Oh, God!

164
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,296
Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.

165
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:05,050
Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

166
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:07,386
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

167
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:15,060
-What?
-Nothing.

168
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:21,191
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

169
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,693
Fine.

170
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,571
It's a humdinger.

171
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,740
Well, then it's really too bad
that you can't tell me.

172
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,325
Somebody likes you!

173
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,998
Is it Chandler?

174
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:40,377
-No!
-Then tell him to stop staring.

175
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,629
It's Joey.

176
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:47,551
Really? Joey? You don't say.

177
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,139
-Is it something you'd be interested in?
-I don't know, I don't know.

178
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:56,477
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

179
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,607
But, you know, on the other hand..

180
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:06,236
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

181
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,114
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

182
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:14,620
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

183
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:18,749
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

184
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:23,378
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

185
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,467
-Not Chandler. Just Joey.
-Sure.

186
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,645
You know what? I've been thinking about it.
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

187
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,564
I think I would actually consider
naming our child that.

188
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:47,611
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

189
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:52,658
Wait a minute.

190
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:59,164
Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

191
00:13:59,414 --> 00:14:03,085
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

192
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:06,171
You did see. You know it's a boy!

193
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:09,675
I didn't see anything.
I actually changed my mind about the name.

194
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,761
I don't think so.
You're giving me Ruth..

195
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,223
so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

196
00:14:16,473 --> 00:14:22,354
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

197
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,856
I would.. Sequoia!

198
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,068
-Veto.
-Fine.

199
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:32,906
Unless..

200
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:37,202
you anticipated
that I would figure all this out..

201
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:40,789
and you know that
it actually is a girl.

202
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:44,501
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

203
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,382
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

204
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:55,512
-But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
-Not like this!

205
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:01,768
What's up?

206
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:06,148
-Joey, I know.
-What?

207
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:11,236
-I know.
-What?

208
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:16,575
-I know about your feelings.
-Oh, my God, you do?

209
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:21,997
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

210
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:27,419
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for those guys.

211
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,088
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

212
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,260
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

213
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:40,640
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

214
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,644
She's my pregnant friend
who's Ross 'ex!

215
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,021
Yeah, that's Rachel.

216
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,939
Beat me over the head with it.

217
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:55,113
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

218
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:59,117
I stayed up all last night and made a list
of everything I don't like about her.

219
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,161
-You wanna hear it?
-Yeah.

220
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:09,711
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

221
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,298
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

222
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,096
Joey, I think you're getting upset for
nothing. This is probably just a crush.

223
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,764
You think?

224
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,851
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but then it goes away.

225
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,564
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

226
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:32,693
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

227
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,779
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

228
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,616
I know I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

229
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,414
-And I'm sure you've had them for us.
-Not really.

230
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:48,834
Throw me a bone here.

231
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:01,221
So I called the doctor.

232
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:05,976
-Now we both know the sex of the baby.
-What?

233
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,313
That's right.
The student has become the master.

234
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:16,486
-Ross, I swear. I don't know.
-Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

235
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,155
A what?

236
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:20,740
You really didn't know?

237
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,452
-We're having a girl?
-No.

238
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,537
-That's what you said.
-No.

239
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:29,875
-You said girl.
-Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

240
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,461
I'm not! We're having a girl!

241
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:37,674
Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
but still, we're having a girl!

242
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:43,263
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

243
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:46,767
Yes, we'll have ourselves
a little baby Ruth.

244
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,774
-Permission to veto.
-Yes, please.

245
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:03,325
Do I smell essential oils?

246
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:07,037
Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath.
I was just gonna get a magazine.

247
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,679
What do you think you're doing?

248
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,934
Leaving my troubles behind?

249
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:34,231
I know that you're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

250
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,109
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

251
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:42,322
Okay, fine. You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

252
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,616
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

253
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,121
Hi, bubbles. Manly.

254
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,209
I thought I would drop by
and let you know how it went.

255
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:56,253
You told her?

256
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,007
She pulled it out of me!
She's like a conversational wizard!

257
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:05,095
-How did it go?
-You were wrong. He doesn't like me.

258
00:19:05,303 --> 00:19:08,598
How would you like it if I sent you
to Lee Majors' house..

259
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,892
and I told you he liked you
and you went there..

260
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,187
and you found out that he didn't like you.
How would you feel?

261
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:20,819
-I don't think I'd care.
-Really? Lee Majors is hot.

262
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:26,658
-Hello?
-We're in the bathroom!

263
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,246
-Why?
-Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

264
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:37,419
-What are you guys doing in here?
-Oh, my God.

265
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,257
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

266
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,884
-It's Rachel!
-You like Rachel?

267
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:49,973
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

268
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,225
Dude, you gotta rearrange
your bubbles.

269
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,439
Mazel tov.

270
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:02,444
Ross and I were looking for you.

271
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:06,948
What are we all doing in here?
Oh, my.

272
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:13,705
-Honey, cover it up with the boat.
-It's not an aircraft carrier.

273
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,374
Hello?

274
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,545
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

275
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:28,470
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

276
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,224
-Did you tell them?
-No. I was waiting for you.

277
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,935
-Tell us what?
-We're having a girl.

278
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,688
Oh, wow! Really?

279
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,777
I'll get you later.

280
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:54,746
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

281
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,707
That's all. Just a little crush.

282
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,753
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy.

283
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:05,924
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

284
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:13,598
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

285
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,145
-Hi, sweetie.
-I love you.

286
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,280
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

287
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:34,119
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

288
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,287
I'm not touching you.

289
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:39,791
-You're not?
-It's the salts.

290
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,378
Oh, sweet Lord,
new realms of pleasure.

291
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:47,924
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
