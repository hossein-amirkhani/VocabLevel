1
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:06,374
Is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary?

2
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:07,667
-Sure.
-Yeah.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,129
-Who's the guy?
-Parker, we met at the cleaners.

4
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:15,508
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

5
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:19,137
Who said that?

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,392
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

7
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:30,398
He treats me like a queen. Except
when he treats me like a naughty girl.

8
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,527
Would it be okay if I give the toast?

9
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:37,655
Even after what happened
at their 20th?

10
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:42,368
-I'd really like to.
-Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

11
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:47,999
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

12
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:53,880
-This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
-You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

13
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:59,218
Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone
cries and pats him on the back.

14
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:04,140
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,728
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

16
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:13,232
Well, at least one
person will be crying.

17
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,653
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

18
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:21,908
-Really? You can do that?
-Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

19
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,254
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me!

20
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:19,215
Hey.

21
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,926
Oh, my God.
You look so fantastic.

22
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,304
On my way over,
I pictured you in my mind's eye.

23
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:28,140
Now I'm like,
"Mind's eye, you had no idea!"

24
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,605
-Let's do that again!
-Okay.

25
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,740
-What are you doing?
-I'm working on my toast.

26
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,452
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

27
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,998
I cannot wait to see them cry.

28
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:56,460
It's not gonna be like regular crying. It's
gonna be like Terms of Endearment crying.

29
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:02,008
I'm gonna reduce my parents
to sniffling, quaking masses of..

30
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,553
I may have some unresolved anger
from my childhood.

31
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,931
-Hey, check this out.
-It's a dog.

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,684
It's a dead dog.

33
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,896
Chi-Chi. She died
when I was in high school.

34
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,983
-You're talking about a dead pet?
-It's good stuff, huh?

35
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:26,032
Joey? You got a present
for my parents?

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,037
In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

37
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:37,460
-That is so cool.
-And I got Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

38
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,089
You know, I think maybe
the one present is enough.

39
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,597
-Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
-Sure.

40
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:56,354
What do you need? We got lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt..

41
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,024
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

42
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:08,282
Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.

43
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:13,079
Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

44
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:19,335
-What?
-You're the 200-pounder who rode her!

45
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:26,509
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is..

46
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:31,722
No, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel..

47
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:35,685
and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

48
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,730
Chandler, I'm kidding!
Already you're my favorite.

49
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,860
-Tell me a little about yourselves.
-Actually, we should get going.

50
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:48,239
Classic Ross!

51
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:54,370
Rachel, look how you glow! May I?

52
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,956
I think you already are.

53
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:00,584
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

54
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:06,465
Is there anything more miraculous..
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?

55
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,220
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

56
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,518
Well, at least you were lucky to have
him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

57
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:21,522
You guys, we really should get going.

58
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,984
There I go again, my catch phrase.

59
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:28,529
-So where's the party?
-It's in Massapequa.

60
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:34,452
Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it
steeped in Native American history?

61
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,164
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

62
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:41,125
I've got my notes.
You got the presents?

63
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:45,337
-I've got the car keys.
-We're driving? Aces.

64
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:52,303
-So he seems like a nice guy.
-Yeah, I like him a lot.

65
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:57,475
-You want to hang back and take a cab?
-Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

66
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:09,361
-Hey, Mom.
-This is such a great party!

67
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:14,700
Thirty-five years. Impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?

68
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:19,997
-Jack?
-Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

69
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:23,709
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

70
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:29,840
-Congratulations, you two.
-Thank you, we're so excited.

71
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:33,719
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

72
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:38,557
-Can we talk to you for just a moment?
-Yeah.

73
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,852
It's just a little thing.

74
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:47,942
While we think it's marvelous you're
having this baby out of wedlock..

75
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:51,403
our friends are less open-minded.

76
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,198
-We told them you're married.
-What?

77
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,867
Thanks for going along with this.

78
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:02,414
-We have to pretend that we're married?
-I had to shave my ears.

79
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:03,916
You can do this.

80
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:07,753
-Can you believe that?
-I know.

81
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:12,383
If you do the ears, you may as well
take a pass at the nose.

82
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,886
I don't want to have to lie
about being married.

83
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:20,015
I don't either. But it's their party,
and it's one night.

84
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:22,768
We don't have to lie.
We won't talk.

85
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,313
If it comes up,
we'll smile, we'll nod along..

86
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:27,606
-Ross?
-Rachel?

87
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:31,110
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

88
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:36,240
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

89
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:42,121
-Here's something to start you out.
-How's marriage treating you?

90
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,916
-Unbelievable. It's great!
-We love marriage.

91
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,543
We'll see you later.

92
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,962
-Hey!
-Hi!

93
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,924
Can I just say, Monica,
that your driving is exquisite.

94
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,553
Thanks. Like I said before,
I pretty much just stayed in the lines..

95
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,263
and tried not to hit anybody.

96
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,934
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

97
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:09,565
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C..

98
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:14,820
I feel so lucky. Think of the good
times that happened here.

99
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:20,117
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

100
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:25,247
None will compare with tonight.
I don't want to forget it.

101
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:30,711
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

102
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,590
I don't think the flash went off.

103
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,554
-I'm gonna find the men's room.
-I'll go with you.

104
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,224
Somewhere there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun..

105
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,101
and a huge butterfly net looking
for that man.

106
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:52,483
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

107
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,527
Glad we weren't in the car.
Did he let up?

108
00:08:55,736 --> 00:09:00,032
He called the Long Island
Expressway a "concrete miracle."

109
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:03,494
This room. This night.

110
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:09,667
That waiter! His shoes!
I must take a mental picture!

111
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,502
Sorry.

112
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,592
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

113
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:22,346
That depends, how much did you hear?

114
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,142
He's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

115
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:30,312
-It's so much.
-Well, so what? I like him.

116
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:34,692
Do I make fun of the people you date?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

117
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:39,280
No, because friends don't do that.
Do you want my opinion?

118
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:45,953
Your collective dating record reads
like a who's who of human crap!

119
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,749
-I feel terrible.
-I know.

120
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,794
What was wrong with Mona?

121
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,592
-Open it, open it, open it.
-Yeah, baby!

122
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,680
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

123
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:10,978
-We were surprised we weren't invited.
-No, it was a small wedding.

124
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:15,899
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

125
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:20,904
-Where did you have it?
-On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

126
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:26,368
And Stevie Wonder sang " Isn't She
Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.

127
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:30,581
-Stevie's a family friend.
-Oh, my God. That's amazing.

128
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:34,626
-I'd love to see pictures.
-Yeah, so would I.

129
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:40,382
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

130
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,219
Would you excuse us for a second?

131
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,312
-What are you doing?
-What? This may be my only wedding.

132
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,941
-And I want it to be amazing.
-Okay.

133
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:02,529
-Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
-Ross, it has to be realistic.

134
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:11,705
Say, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

135
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:17,628
-No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
-And I'm with you. What a great time!

136
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,091
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

137
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:27,554
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

138
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,392
Oysters! Let me feed you.
That's not necessary.

139
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,102
-Please?
-I don't eat..

140
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,688
-I won't quit until you try one.
-Okay, fine.

141
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:42,403
-Good.
-What're they like? I've never had one.

142
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,740
-Try one.
-They look too weird.

143
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:51,703
I know, I know.

144
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:57,084
Listen, your family is really
starting to warm up to me.

145
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,461
You just kissed the caterer.

146
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:06,009
-What are you doing?
-Going over my toast.

147
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,390
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

148
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:16,228
If you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just..

149
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:22,401
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

150
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,071
-Blind?
-Not at first, but it's intricate work.

151
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,576
They said even though they lost
their sight, it was worth it.

152
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:34,371
-I bet you looked beautiful.
-Well, I don't know.

153
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:39,585
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

154
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:44,631
-How did you propose?
-Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

155
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:49,928
Well, actually, I took her
to the planetarium.

156
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,974
That's where we had our first date.

157
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:58,937
I had the room filled with lilies,
her favorite flower.

158
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:03,358
-That is so sweet!
-I want to hear the rest!

159
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:09,823
Then Fred Astaire singing,
"The Way You Look Tonight" came on..

160
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,993
the lights came down,
I got on one knee..

161
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:17,581
and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

162
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,459
"Will you marry me?"

163
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:25,422
And the ring was the size of my fist.

164
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,052
Hey, Phoebe? Look..

165
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:35,265
I want to apologize. Okay?
We were being jerks.

166
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:39,561
-Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.
-You better do it now.

167
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,231
-Why?
-Because I'm gonna kill him.

168
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:47,152
-What?
-He's too excited about everything.

169
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:51,740
I'm all for living, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

170
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,993
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

171
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm having the worst time.

172
00:13:57,287 --> 00:14:01,458
There was a line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates..

173
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,878
I slipped on a giant booger.

174
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:10,133
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

175
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:13,887
It could've been.
I didn't look at it.

176
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:18,058
I wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out.

177
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:22,229
I thought he was a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

178
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:25,899
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

179
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:28,443
There's nothing wrong with him.

180
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:30,654
-You think?
-Yeah, know what?

181
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,616
-We were all just being too negative.
-You're right.

182
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:39,913
He's just embracing life. We could
all stand to be more like Parker.

183
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,709
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a positive person!

184
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:47,170
-Actually, you have an edge.
-What's that?

185
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:52,050
-Oh, it's Parker!
-Look, the Bunny Hop!

186
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,927
-Oh, I love it!
-You do?

187
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:58,849
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on!

188
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,478
Okay, it's time for the toast.

189
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:08,442
I know normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'll do it.

190
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:13,363
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

191
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,616
Okay.

192
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:20,203
Mom, Dad, when I got married..

193
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:26,501
the thing that made me sure I could
do it was the example you two set.

194
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:30,797
For that, and other things,
I want to thank you.

195
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:34,968
I know I probably don't
say it enough..

196
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,471
but I love you.

197
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:54,946
When I look around, I'm saddened by the
thought of those who could not be here.

198
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,619
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

199
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:02,746
But she can't..

200
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,623
because she's dead.

201
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:11,338
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

202
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:16,385
I mean, look how cute she is.. was.

203
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,556
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

204
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:26,853
Remember she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

205
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,526
Wow!

206
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:39,324
Does anybody remember when..

207
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:45,122
Debra Winger had to say goodbye to
her children in Terms of Endearment?

208
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,083
Didn't see that?

209
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,545
No movie fans?!

210
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,465
You want to hear something sad?

211
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:59,970
I was watching a 60 Minutes
piece on orphans in Romania..

212
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,267
who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

213
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:14,025
You people are made of stone!

214
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:17,571
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

215
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,414
Thank you, Monica.
That was interesting.

216
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:32,377
-Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
-Why don't I remember this dog?

217
00:17:34,713 --> 00:17:37,924
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

218
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:42,012
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

219
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:46,641
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

220
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:49,895
No, of course.

221
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:58,236
Everybody? I just wanted to say..

222
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:01,656
on behalf of my new bride, Rachel..

223
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,872
and myself, that if..

224
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:15,045
if in 35 years, we're half
as happy as you guys are..

225
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,508
we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

226
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,968
Oh, Ross.

227
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:29,643
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

228
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:40,153
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

229
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:46,201
Can I get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

230
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:50,705
I must say, this apartment,
it's.. there are no words.

231
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:53,542
-Thank God.
-It's a haven.

232
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:59,089
-A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.
-Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

233
00:18:59,297 --> 00:19:05,720
Listen, why don't we just sit and
relax, just be with each other quietly.

234
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,306
That sounds great.

235
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:13,019
This is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on.

236
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,189
Let's try something.
Let's play a game.

237
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,150
-I love games.
-Shocking.

238
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:23,113
Let's play the game of..

239
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:27,284
who can stay quiet the longest.

240
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:29,452
Or Jenga.

241
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:37,085
Let's play this one first, and
remember, whoever talks first loses.

242
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:45,010
-I lose, now Jenga.
-Oh, my God.

243
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:49,222
-Is something wrong?
-You know the word "wrong"?

244
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,017
Everything isn't perfect or magical?

245
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:55,979
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of fairies?

246
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,523
They were just brake lights, Parker!

247
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,736
Excuse me for putting a good spin
on a traffic jam.

248
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:06,740
You don't have to put
a good spin on everything!

249
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:11,703
-I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.
-No, I'm a positive person.

250
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:16,082
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

251
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:19,961
At Disneyland, getting laid!

252
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:25,008
You want me to be negative?
You want me to be less happy?

253
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,260
Much less happy.

254
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:31,598
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

255
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:35,518
So long!

256
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:41,066
Don't let the "best door in the world"
hit you in the ass on your way out.

257
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:49,658
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've had in your life?

258
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:58,500
We could've gone from the ceremony to
the reception with you in the sidecar.

259
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,585
It just isn't feasible.

260
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:06,383
But a dove placing the ring on your
finger would've been no problem.

261
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:13,056
-It was fun being married to you.
-Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.

262
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:18,144
-Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

263
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:23,024
-That proposal at the planetarium?
-I know, I know. It was stupid.

264
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:29,155
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

265
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:34,411
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

266
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,872
I thought of it
when we were going out.

267
00:21:38,123 --> 00:21:42,836
That's how I imagined
I would ask you to marry me.

268
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,338
Wow.

269
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:50,760
Well, that would've been
very hard to say no to.

270
00:21:53,722 --> 00:21:59,185
It's a good thing I didn't do it, it
sounds like a very expensive wedding.

271
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,112
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

272
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:16,369
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
to protect your hair?

273
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:19,914
-I will think about it.
-That's all I'm asking.

274
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,503
Okay, that's it. I give up.

275
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,340
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you give the speech.

276
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,303
You know, I don't understand
why they didn't cry.

277
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:36,598
-Come on.
-That stuff you said about true love?

278
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,352
You were right. We did learn
a lot from Mom and Dad.

279
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:45,315
That picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

280
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:51,988
And what you said about Nana? Yeah,
she really would've wanted to be there.

281
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:54,908
And you know what?

282
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,119
I think she was.

283
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,249
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it?
