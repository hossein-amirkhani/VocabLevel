1
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:04,831
-Guys, guess what?
-What?

2
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:08,000
We're having a Halloween party!

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,335
-Good!
-Great!

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:13,715
-You have to wear a costume.
-I can't make it.

5
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:15,675
Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:20,888
I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,642
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,728
Not two years in a row.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,150
-I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
-You have to.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,072
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

11
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:41,075
You're an actor.

12
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,786
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

13
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:46,414
-I will.
-The girl from the wedding?

14
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:51,961
If she needs costume ideas,
she could be a bikini model..

15
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,715
or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

16
00:00:55,965 --> 00:01:01,971
Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw
Massacre. No! Slutty Leatherface.

17
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:06,392
Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?

18
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,479
That's right, he was hitting on her.

19
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:14,442
And I got her. I guess
the better man won.

20
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:17,778
Please don't take her from me.

21
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,613
Ursula!

22
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,407
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

23
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:07,036
I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

24
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:08,454
Wait a second!

25
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,706
So, what's new with you?

26
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:14,669
Nothing.
I'm getting married next week.

27
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,420
What?

28
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,840
It'll be a small ceremony.
Just family.

29
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,342
His.

30
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,554
Okay.

31
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,347
I'm happy for you.

32
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,519
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

33
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:32,895
-Really?
-Sure.

34
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,773
You could be my sister for the day.

35
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,151
Yeah, okay.

36
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:44,156
My friends are having a party tonight,
so you could come.

37
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,617
Maybe I could meet the guy.

38
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,787
Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.

39
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,749
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

40
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:58,129
-It's a costume party.
-So that's why you're..

41
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,381
No.

42
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,883
But thanks.

43
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,101
-You're supposed to wear a costume.
-I am.

44
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:16,856
I am a woman who spent money
on a dress she wants to wear..

45
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,651
because soon she won't
fit into it.

46
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:25,239
I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

47
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,201
-Trick or treat!
-Can I give out candy?

48
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:34,373
I want to be with kids. Since I got
pregnant, I have maternal instincts.

49
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:37,501
-Trick or treat!
-Just a minute!

50
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,301
Look at you guys!

51
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:50,056
-Wow! You are a very scary witch.
-Thank you.

52
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:54,185
-And you are a very funny clown.
-Thank you.

53
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,770
And you..

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,523
are so in style right now.

55
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:05,112
I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line
has got this equestrian theme.

56
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:10,242
-Did you see the cover of Vogue..?
-Could I just have the candy?

57
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,622
Sure.

58
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,716
Catwoman. So we meet again.

59
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,885
So we do, Supergirl.

60
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,138
It's me, Phoebe.

61
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:36,102
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

62
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:43,901
I appreciate the costume.

63
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,362
You did this to him?

64
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,239
I thought he'd love it.

65
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:54,662
-He loves The Velveteen Rabbit.
-That rabbit was brown and white.

66
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,164
It was pink, or no bunny at all.

67
00:04:57,415 --> 00:05:01,335
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

68
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:08,634
-You didn't dress up either?
-Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

69
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:15,349
Dude, what happened?

70
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,268
How is that me?

71
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,813
I'm Chandler.

72
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:24,525
That is so you!

73
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:29,280
-When have I ever done that?
-When have I ever done that?

74
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,910
Trick or treat.

75
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:43,043
-You're the prettiest ballerina ever.
-Thank you.

76
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,881
That deserves another candy.

77
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,091
Thank you.

78
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:54,930
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

79
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,725
I love you!

80
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,229
Honey, here, take it all.

81
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,236
Monica? We need more candy.

82
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:12,073
-There's only been four kids.
-I know.

83
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:16,035
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

84
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,162
No wonder you're pregnant.

85
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:30,466
-What are you supposed to be?
-Remember the satellite, Sputnik?

86
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:35,471
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"..

87
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,766
and these are my antenna.

88
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:42,061
So Sputnik becomes..?

89
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:49,985
Spud-nik!

90
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,990
Wow! I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

91
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:59,787
All right! Ross came as doodie.

92
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:05,167
-No, I'm not doodie.
-No, space-doodie.

93
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,838
Okay, I'm Spud-nik.

94
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:14,343
-You know, like Sputnik.
-What's a Sputnik, doodie-man?

95
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,310
Hey, sweetie.

96
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:28,315
-Aren't you gonna kiss me?
-Okay.

97
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:32,069
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

98
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,446
-Ursula?
-Ursula's fiance?

99
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:39,994
You're the sister. I just slapped
my future sister-in-law's ass.

100
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:43,664
Is your mother here?
I could slap her on the butt.

101
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:47,877
-My mother killed herself.
-See, and I knew that.

102
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,881
Now I'm sweating.

103
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:57,219
I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

104
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,138
No. We'll start over.

105
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,224
-Hi, I'm Phoebe.
-Eric.

106
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:07,104
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Sweat's burning my eyes.

107
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,731
-Thank you.
-There.

108
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,650
-What are you?
-There's no name for it.

109
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,987
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

110
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:20,993
-No, I meant your costume.
-I'm a solar system.

111
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,370
My second graders helped.

112
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:26,540
-I love the second grade.
-Really?

113
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:32,504
It's much better than first grade,
and definitely better than third.

114
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:36,258
With all the politics
and the mind games.

115
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:41,680
-So, what do you do?
-I'm a masseuse, by day.

116
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:46,310
-You don't have to stand with me.
-I'm having fun.

117
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:51,732
-I'm excited for you and Ursula.
-I feel very lucky. She's great.

118
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:56,695
-She's the most beautiful woman ever.
-Thank you.

119
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,245
-Hey, Joey?
-Yeah?

120
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:08,415
-You read comic books, right?
-Exclusively.

121
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:12,127
Who would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

122
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,546
-Catwoman, hands down.
-Yeah.

123
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:18,175
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give Phoebe the edge.

124
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,177
-What? Really?
-You kidding?

125
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:25,933
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

126
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,852
She's not right behind me, is she?

127
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,729
No, you're fine.

128
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,857
-Could I take Rachel?
-I'm not sure.

129
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,610
What? Come on, I am tough!

130
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:39,571
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

131
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,200
Relax. Why are you so serious?
It doesn't matter.

132
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,289
Really? What if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

133
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,666
I would say, "Woman, please."

134
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:56,005
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.

135
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:59,925
-You think you could take him?
-The dude with the balls on his chest?

136
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,593
I think so.

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,430
But what is he doing with my sister?
He's so great.

138
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,224
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

139
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:14,106
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

140
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,483
-Oh, my God, Phoebe?
-What?

141
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:21,780
-You're getting a crush on him.
-No, I'm not, you are!

142
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,950
Here comes the temper.

143
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,746
Trick or treat.

144
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:33,500
Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went for more.

145
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:38,714
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

146
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,300
-Can I write you a check?
-Okay.

147
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,388
-Okay. What's your name?
-Lelani Mayolanofavich.

148
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:52,227
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

149
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,564
-Hi.
-Hi, Mona.

150
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:02,654
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was
hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.

151
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:05,991
Actually, I'm just a nurse.

152
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:11,413
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but I'm maxed out.

153
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,500
-You made it.
-Wait.

154
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:19,004
-You're a potato?
-Well, I'm a spud..?

155
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:23,550
-And the antenna.. You're Spud-nik!
-Yes!

156
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:26,637
Marry her.

157
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:32,392
Here's a good one. Who'd win
a fight between Ross and Chandler?

158
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:35,062
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

159
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:37,731
-So Ross?
-Yeah.

160
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,276
-Hey, beautiful.
-Hello, handsome.

161
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,778
Oh, God.

162
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,908
Look at you two.
When did you guys meet?

163
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,536
-Two weeks ago.
-That's it?

164
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:54,498
I know. It sounds crazy,
and I'm not impulsive, but..

165
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:58,794
-we have so much in common.
-Oh, really?

166
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:01,338
We're both teachers.

167
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:07,594
-And we were both in the Peace Corps.
-Peace Corps, really?

168
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:15,310
When we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and never met.

169
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,732
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

170
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,778
-Shall we get me really drunk?
-Sure.

171
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,619
Howdy, doodie.

172
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:34,788
That's funny, yeah.

173
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:39,793
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

174
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,423
Relax, man. You're looking
a little flushed.

175
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:53,056
-Our question might get answered.
-What question?

176
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,768
Who could kick whose ass in a fight,
you or Ross?

177
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,981
-There's no question.
-So you think Ross too?

178
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:06,236
-You picked Ross?
-Ross is strong.

179
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:11,200
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

180
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:16,455
-I can't believe you didn't pick me.
-She's right. I am stronger.

181
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,957
I would destroy you.

182
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:23,921
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

183
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,549
I'll prove it like a theorem!

184
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,927
All right! Stop it!

185
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,305
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

186
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:37,100
People came to see a fight,
let's give them one!

187
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:43,482
-You guys could arm-wrestle.
-Listen to the slutty nurse.

188
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,654
-You're going down.
-Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!

189
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:52,908
Seriously, guys, the trash talk
is embarrassing.

190
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:58,247
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much.

191
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:01,333
-You are so sweet.
-Really?

192
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:06,338
You are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

193
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,508
-Got to go.
-Trick or treat.

194
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:13,512
Hi! Wow! There you go.

195
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:18,475
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

196
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,645
We were, but now we've got candy.

197
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,940
I'd rather have the money.

198
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:28,986
That's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

199
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,529
This isn't fair.

200
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,116
Is it fair that you put on a cape
and get stuff?

201
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,368
Shut up!

202
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,036
You shut up!

203
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:44,126
-You can't tell me to shut up.
-I think I just did.

204
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,753
And here it comes again. Shut up!

205
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,216
No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

206
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:56,263
Wait, I had one more thing to say.
Right. Shut up.

207
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,057
You're a mean old woman.

208
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:01,143
Wait! Shut.. Don't cry!

209
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,395
Let me get my checkbook!

210
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:08,734
You don't have to do this. The
strength inside you means the most.

211
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:13,280
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

212
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,283
That's the strength I want in a man.

213
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,745
That means nothing to me. Come on!

214
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,498
-Hi, liar.
-Hey.

215
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:30,172
He's marrying you because he thinks
the things you were saying were true.

216
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,924
-They could be true.
-But they're not.

217
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,510
It's a fine line.

218
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,222
-Why are you lying?
-I don't know.

219
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:44,811
He did this stuff, I said I did it too.
He got so excited, it was fun.

220
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:48,106
You can't do this.
You're gonna ruin his life.

221
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,027
Why are you taking this so seriously?
It's just a marriage.

222
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,615
Besides, if I cheat on him,
I can call it an affair.

223
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:57,866
Honey?

224
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:02,954
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

225
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,707
She's helped so many people quit.

226
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,293
We'd better get going.

227
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,380
-You have a church group meeting.
-Right.

228
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,346
-It was nice meeting you.
-You too.

229
00:16:19,638 --> 00:16:23,517
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

230
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,896
Come on! Bunny versus doodie.
We're waiting!

231
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:33,151
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

232
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,655
Wait. What does the winner get?

233
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,865
-Pride.
-And dignity.

234
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,702
Okay, if you say so.

235
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,954
All right, ready, set, go!

236
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,707
-Come on!
-Come on!

237
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,386
-Wow, they're both really strong.
-Or equally weak.

238
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,390
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

239
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:14,276
-So you getting tired?
-No. I could do this all day.

240
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,903
Yeah. Me too.

241
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:23,034
-Getting a little tired, though.
-God, I'm exhausted.

242
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:28,415
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

243
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,712
She's talking to Joey!
You gotta let me win!

244
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,715
Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

245
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:42,554
At least you have a wife.
I get divorces and knock people up.

246
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,975
And I'm dressed as doodie.

247
00:17:47,893 --> 00:17:53,607
-You're Spud-nik.
-Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

248
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,735
Please? She's watching.

249
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,906
-Fine.
-Thanks.

250
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,451
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah!

251
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,329
My hero!

252
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,915
You're a weird lady.

253
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,087
Ursula said she left her purse.

254
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,966
What a relief. It has the numbers
for her prayer chain.

255
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:22,302
I'm sure it does.

256
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,514
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.

257
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:30,602
I don't think I'm gonna make it
to the wedding.

258
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:33,271
I wish you all the luck in the world.

259
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,149
And I also want to give you
a little piece of advice..

260
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,819
that I give to everyone
who's getting married.

261
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,654
Don't trust your wife.

262
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:43,824
I think we'll be okay.

263
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:48,411
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

264
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,251
-I can't let you do this. She's lying.
-What?

265
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:58,630
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

266
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:02,092
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

267
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:07,764
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

268
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:12,936
Here's the name tag from
where she works as a waitress.

269
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,438
Not a teacher, a waitress.

270
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,275
Here, she always lies about this.

271
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:23,196
-How old did she say she was?
-She told me she was 25.

272
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:26,074
I almost don't want to show you.

273
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:29,286
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

274
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:34,291
I am so stupid.

275
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,793
Of course she's not a teacher.

276
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:42,465
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

277
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,845
No, you're not stupid.

278
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,890
I'm not smart.

279
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:57,814
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

280
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,900
-To be romantic.
-Good.

281
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:06,114
You should be impulsive and romantic.
You did it with the wrong person.

282
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:12,495
-What?
-It's weird, two people look so alike.

283
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,414
And so different.

284
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,753
Eric! Let's go!

285
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,716
-Better go deal with it.
-Yeah, you should.

286
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:33,266
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

287
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,156
I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

288
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:49,449
That's not bad.

289
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:53,703
I also had to go to a few houses
as his girlfriend.

290
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:57,040
I am awful with children.

291
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:01,711
You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

292
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,382
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

293
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,176
-That's all it is?
-Absolutely.

294
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:15,058
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

295
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,395
They get crazy during the summer too.

296
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:22,065
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

297
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:25,443
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that.

298
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,117
Look, I'm sorry you lost.

299
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,079
I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

300
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,457
Was that a secret, or a lie?

301
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,751
-No, I let him.. Ross?
-Yeah?

302
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:45,130
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

303
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:49,009
Chandler "let me win."

304
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,515
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

305
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,852
I am strong. I'll show you.

306
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:00,520
Chandler, please.

307
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,689
What's the matter? Scared?

308
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,526
