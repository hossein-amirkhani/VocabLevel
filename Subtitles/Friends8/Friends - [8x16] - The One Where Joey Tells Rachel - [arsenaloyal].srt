1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,912
Previously:

2
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:06,791
There's this woman that I like a lot.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,210
But it's complicated.

4
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:12,797
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

5
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,384
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

6
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:20,722
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he a good guy?

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,599
The best.

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,352
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

9
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:29,897
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

10
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:31,774
I do, so much.

11
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,777
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

12
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,448
You know what?
You have to go for it.

13
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:43,494
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

14
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,622
It's Rachel.

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,719
I'm sorry, did you just say
it's Rachel?

16
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:02,805
Yes.

17
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,643
You like Rachel?

18
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:12,815
Yes. I like Rachel.

19
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,532
Rachel?!

20
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:25,077
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know..

21
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:27,663
You know who else I like? You.

22
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:31,667
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

23
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,380
-"Rachel" Rachel?
-It's not a big deal.

24
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:40,051
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just..

25
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,513
What about the stuff you said?

26
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:48,434
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

27
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:50,478
I'm an actor, you know?

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,649
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

29
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:58,069
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

30
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,656
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

31
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:04,992
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

32
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,204
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

33
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,998
You know, I gotta go.

34
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:12,500
Hey, Ross..

35
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:16,671
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?!

36
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,976
Rachel?!

37
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:11,517
Okay, she's kicking.

38
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,937
She's growing inside you.

39
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,985
-That was a big one.
-That's the youngest girl to reject me.

40
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,404
-You guys!
-Hey there.

41
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:26,907
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

42
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,409
Oh, yes, I do.

43
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:31,412
There's one person out there
for everyone.

44
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,624
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

45
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,877
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

46
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,921
He'll find me.

47
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,339
And you?

48
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:46,719
No. I believe that certain people
are more suited for each other, but..

49
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,555
-Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
-Good.

50
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,558
-Why?
-Well, last night, I met Monica's.

51
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,648
What?

52
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,777
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

53
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:08,157
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

54
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,329
Well, what's he like?

55
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,958
-He's tall. He has brown hair.
-Of course.

56
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:21,629
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

57
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,882
-He works with food.
-Oh, sure. Older?

58
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,636
-Obviously. And he's British.
-I was just gonna ask!

59
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:33,307
And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

60
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,977
It's so sad they never met.

61
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:40,773
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

62
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,776
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

63
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,987
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

64
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,157
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

65
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,577
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

66
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,794
Rachel?!

67
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:08,759
I didn't know Joey was on JAG.

68
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,185
-Hey.
-Hey.

69
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:21,689
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

70
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:25,985
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

71
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,321
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

72
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,408
I know you're hurting..

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,660
but don't say that again.

74
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:40,541
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

75
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,877
You don't need to worry.

76
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:45,588
He'll never tell her how he feels.

77
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,716
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

78
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:52,928
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

79
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:57,933
-He isn't thinking about going for her.
-He's not?

80
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,854
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

81
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:06,067
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

82
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:10,571
-Why?
-He wants to leave the country.

83
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,077
He thinks you hate him.

84
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,830
Hate him?

85
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,959
No, I don't hate him.

86
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:29,423
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

87
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:33,719
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you..

88
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,932
but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

89
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:42,603
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

90
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,899
Okay, I'll talk to him.

91
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,776
I'd do it soon.

92
00:06:49,068 --> 00:06:53,948
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

93
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,289
-Hi!
-Hi.

94
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:05,918
-Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
-Hello.

95
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:08,087
Hello, nice to meet you.
How are you?

96
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,922
Soul mate.

97
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:16,428
-What are you guys doing?
-We had lunch at Adriatica.

98
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:21,308
-What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
-I know! Is this 1985?

99
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:25,229
-That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
-Not really.

100
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:29,108
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

101
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,821
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

102
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,489
No?

103
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,536
-What restaurants do you like?
-Octavio. 27-and-7.

104
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:45,082
-There's this place, Alessandro's.
-Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

105
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,168
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

106
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:52,464
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

107
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,968
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

108
00:07:58,262 --> 00:07:59,346
I'll have a mocha-ccino.

109
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,647
What are you doing?

110
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,902
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

111
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,571
You don't believe in soul mates, so..

112
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,742
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

113
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:25,164
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

114
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,708
Phoebe? Good work.

115
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,586
He's great. I love him.

116
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:36,216
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

117
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:53,067
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

118
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:55,569
No, I don't want to hit you.

119
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,280
What, then? Kick me?

120
00:08:58,614 --> 00:08:59,865
No.

121
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:02,576
Bite me?

122
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,829
I don't want to do anything to you.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,291
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you..

124
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,046
and that I certainly
do not hate you.

125
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,883
I just came here to say that.

126
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:20,427
Hey, wait, Ross?

127
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,599
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

128
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,770
Yeah, sure.

129
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,193
You got any beer?

130
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,283
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

131
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,118
Okay.

132
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,878
You need to understand something.

133
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,137
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

134
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:08,183
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

135
00:10:09,435 --> 00:10:11,020
Thank you.

136
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:31,874
Anyway, it'll just..

137
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,461
It'll take me a while to get over her.

138
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:39,840
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so..

139
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,592
What?

140
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,722
You're in love with her?

141
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:51,643
-Yeah. I thought you knew that.
-No.

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,983
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

143
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:02,571
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

144
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,742
But it just keeps getting harder.

145
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,412
I don't know what to do, you know?

146
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,041
What do I do?

147
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,053
-You need to tell her how you feel.
-That's the green stuff talking.

148
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,558
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

149
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:35,729
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

150
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:39,108
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be..

151
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,653
If she is where you are..

152
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:49,409
then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

153
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,496
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

154
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,625
If she ends up with somebody else..

155
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,754
the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

156
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,298
Hey, thanks.

157
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:09,888
-So when are you gonna talk to her?
-Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

158
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,476
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

159
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:18,522
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

160
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,068
What am I gonna say?

161
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,449
Yeah, tell me about it.

162
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese.

163
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,888
Cheese, you say?

164
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:54,433
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

165
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:58,687
-Excuse me?
-Cheese. It's smelly.

166
00:12:59,563 --> 00:13:03,066
You must smell a lot of the time too.

167
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,489
Not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

168
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:14,411
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

169
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,706
And you're still married to him?

170
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:27,591
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

171
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,093
Not even bread. Just cheese.

172
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,221
No, I want the bread.

173
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,848
And pastries.

174
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,184
And pate.

175
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,230
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

176
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,567
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

177
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,903
Is it made of cheese?

178
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:54,451
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be incredible?

179
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,538
-I'd move in tomorrow!
-Oh, come on!

180
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:01,500
-Listen to this!
-I'm so sorry.

181
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,046
-What do we do?
-They both want a house of cheese.

182
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,633
I don't know how you fight that.

183
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:20,394
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

184
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,980
Okay, stand up straight.

185
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,108
Take a couple deep breaths.

186
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,611
Look confident.

187
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,450
Joey? What's up?

188
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:40,080
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

189
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:41,582
What's up?

190
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,751
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

191
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,422
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

192
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:52,259
I just came by to tell you that..

193
00:14:52,634 --> 00:14:56,513
I want to have dinner with you.

194
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:59,474
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.

195
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,813
Okay. That's good.

196
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:08,358
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

197
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,903
Don't you people ever knock?

198
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,241
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
Wouldn't that be nice?

199
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,909
Sure. Set it up.

200
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,371
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

201
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:24,875
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

202
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,711
Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.

203
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,838
But good enough.

204
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,923
Jeez, what's with you?

205
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,177
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

206
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,849
-What's going on?
-Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

207
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:44,311
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

208
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:49,816
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

209
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:55,155
-You don't believe in soul mates?
-No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.

210
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:59,576
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

211
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,078
-You don't?
-Nope.

212
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,914
We weren't destined
to end up together.

213
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,751
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

214
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,670
Some days we work really hard.

215
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:15,509
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

216
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:21,723
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

217
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:24,434
-I love you.
-I know.

218
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,145
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

219
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:31,817
I found this place that makes
the greatest jalapeno poppers.

220
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,570
No? They taste so good.

221
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:45,372
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

222
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,458
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

223
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:54,756
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, sure.

224
00:16:57,467 --> 00:17:00,262
Look, the reason..

225
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,349
Is it hot in here?

226
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,811
Why don't you take off your sweater?

227
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,772
This is a nice place..

228
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:15,819
and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

229
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:19,823
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

230
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,283
Yeah, sure.

231
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,789
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

232
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,673
How long have we known each other?

233
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:38,758
Seven, eight..

234
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,595
Eight years. Wow.

235
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,346
A long time.

236
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:47,684
But over the past few weeks, I..

237
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:52,439
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

238
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,399
Our specials tonight..

239
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,235
-Could you give us a second?
-Sure.

240
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,778
Second's up!

241
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,619
Not that kind of table.

242
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,457
So you were saying?

243
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,710
I'm not sure.

244
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:18,507
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

245
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,178
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half..

246
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,932
and now here we are.

247
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,352
Yeah. Here we are.

248
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:42,989
I think I'm falling in love with you.

249
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,701
What?

250
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,706
I'm falling in love with you.

251
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:02,050
Who are you talking to?

252
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,429
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

253
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,391
Funny. It's funny!

254
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,726
I don't get it.

255
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:22,654
Okay.

256
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,993
Wow.

257
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,746
Okay, so the specials are..

258
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:42,883
Are you..?

259
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:48,513
How did..?

260
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:50,849
When?

261
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,729
Does it really matter?

262
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,191
Wow. Wow.

263
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,652
It is hot in here.

264
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:04,571
I know this is a lot.

265
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:08,074
You don't have to say anything.

266
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,537
You take as much time as you need.

267
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:21,880
Okay, you gotta say something.

268
00:20:22,756 --> 00:20:27,302
Joey, I love you so much.

269
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,596
-But..
-But.

270
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,890
Joey?

271
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:34,768
Right. Hey, that's..

272
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,312
That's okay. That's fine.

273
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:42,442
It's pretty much what I was expecting.

274
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:46,404
It's no big deal, all right?

275
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,411
-I think I'm gonna go.
-Please don't leave like this.

276
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,374
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

277
00:20:58,249 --> 00:20:59,876
Don't start doing that.

278
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,672
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me..

279
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,882
Oh, there we go!

280
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:11,471
-Can I?
-Sure.

281
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,934
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose..

282
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:18,269
Hey, hey.

283
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,817
You can't, okay? Ever.

284
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,529
I'm so sorry.

285
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:30,824
Please don't be sorry.

286
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,284
Okay? Don't be sorry.

287
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:44,504
You know, I was only kidding.

288
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,091
Yeah, that was a real good one.

289
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:01,771
-Is this your table?
-Yeah.

290
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,441
-You'll be here all night.
-I know.

291
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,318
I haven't even read the specials.

292
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:09,279
What's the matter?

293
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:14,284
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

294
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:19,622
I kind of hope it's the girl.

295
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,668
The guy is really cute!
