1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,542
Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,336
-That's Rachel.
-You have to talk to her.

3
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:14,257
I can't. Not after the other night.
It's too weird.

4
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,467
Don't tell her I'm here.

5
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,012
Don't eat that!

6
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,640
-Hey!
-Hey, Rachel.

7
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:24,350
Is Joey here?

8
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:26,644
-I don't see him. You?
-No.

9
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:30,314
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,193
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:38,281
-What's up?
-I haven't seen him since he said..

12
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:40,116
how he, you know..

13
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:42,952
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,872
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:50,126
-We were playing a game.
-Was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,590
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:59,385
-Sure!
-What? No! No!

18
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:05,057
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that..?

19
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:07,059
Tell him I miss him.

20
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:16,444
-Okay. Did you hear that?
-Yeah. That naked bagel game?

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,700
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
small hole.

22
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,913
-You've gotta talk to her.
-I can't.

23
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,334
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.

24
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,753
I don't know what that's like?

25
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:38,883
Until I was 25, I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,384
No rejection?

27
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,763
I got shot down at fat camp.

28
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:48,142
Boy, kids are mean
when they're hungry.

29
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,521
So, what do I do?

30
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:54,941
It's Rachel.
You're gonna never talk to her again?

31
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:59,278
It's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

32
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,240
Yeah, okay.

33
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,117
I forgot this was on your..

34
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,703
We didn't play it!

35
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,454
I'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.

36
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:53,708
-You read tea leaves?
-I've done it for years.

37
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,169
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

38
00:02:57,336 --> 00:02:59,797
And one of the great joys
of life..

39
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:03,050
is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

40
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:06,220
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

41
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:10,099
-Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
-Okay.

42
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,519
I see a ladder.

43
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:17,607
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

44
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:24,322
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

45
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,033
Who's next?

46
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,827
I'm done. Do mine.

47
00:03:29,994 --> 00:03:31,454
Okay.

48
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,999
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.

49
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,878
Which can either mean
you're having a baby..

50
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,881
or you'll make
a scientific discovery!

51
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:46,594
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

52
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:51,057
-What does yours say, Pheebs?
-All right.

53
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,643
Wow! Yay!

54
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:58,022
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
And really soon!

55
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,566
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

56
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,612
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

57
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,618
Has anyone seen my shirt?

58
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,413
It's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?

59
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,916
You mean your pink shirt?

60
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,794
Faded salmon color?

61
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,505
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

62
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,342
I must have left it at Mona's.
I knew it!

63
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,929
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

64
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,100
That's my favorite shirt.
I love it.

65
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,268
Ask Mona to give it back.

66
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,270
I don't know. I could.

67
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,066
We didn't really end things
on good terms.

68
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:46,362
If I went, I'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do..

69
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,281
jump up my own ass and die.

70
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:55,454
Oh, wait a second, you guys?

71
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,791
I've been seeing that guy
everywhere I go.

72
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,461
We take the same bus,
go to the same bookstore.

73
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,338
Maybe he's the tea guy.

74
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,093
Did you see that?

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,972
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!

76
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:20,646
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What does that mean?

77
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,193
Hi.

78
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,070
Hey.

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,668
-Hi.
-Hi.

80
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,679
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

81
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:03,272
I thought Joey and I
would be okay..

82
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,025
but we don't know
how to be together.

83
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,110
By the way,
I've been meaning to say this.

84
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:11,113
If you guys knew about this,
a heads-up would have been nice.

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,948
Just a little, you know.

86
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,825
"Joey loves you.
Be prepared."

87
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,871
-Sorry.
-Well, for next time.

88
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,876
-It's tough, but things will improve.
-How do you know?

89
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:26,504
What if it gets worse and worse..

90
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,466
to the point where we
can't be in the same room?

91
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,885
I'm not great at the advice.

92
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,514
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

93
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,892
Some cheese?

94
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,899
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

95
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:50,986
If I can't find the right case,
I use the nearest one.

96
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,907
-Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
-The James Taylor case.

97
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,827
-Where is that CD?
-I'll save you time.

98
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:01,580
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

99
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:07,127
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

100
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:10,923
We'll just have to put the CDs
in their right cases.

101
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:15,427
If we do that, we should
come up with some kind of order.

102
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,055
We have to talk this through.

103
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:24,270
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! I feel so terrible for you!

104
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,106
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

105
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:30,609
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.

106
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:32,736
Change the subject.

107
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,031
Get him talking about something else.

108
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:37,783
Yeah, that makes sense.

109
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:41,287
Maybe you need his advice
on a work problem..

110
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,414
-I could do that.
-Good.

111
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:46,876
The Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

112
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:50,296
They were just giving those away
at the store.

113
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:53,591
In exchange for money.

114
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,636
Hey.

115
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:04,935
I really don't know what to tell you.

116
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:09,732
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

117
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,235
-What?
-Yeah, Joey, she's..

118
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:18,240
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher.

119
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:23,370
Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.

120
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:25,915
Yeah, Joey, maybe
you could help her out.

121
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,750
-Okay.
-Oh, and you know what?

122
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,835
While you're helping
solve this problem..

123
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:34,006
you might want to do something with
your hands. Like, off the top of my head..

124
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,425
maybe put the CDs
in their right cases.

125
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,677
Here we go.

126
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,183
So you have a big work problem?

127
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah. It's, uh..

128
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,939
Yeah, it's, uh..

129
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,902
You know, it's nothing.

130
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,404
Okay.

131
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,744
So I think I'm gonna take off.

132
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:08,499
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's..

133
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,251
It's my boss.

134
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,504
-Yeah?
-Yeah. And, uh..

135
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,091
And my baby.

136
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:18,842
Yeah?

137
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,972
My boss wants to buy my baby.

138
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,143
What? Oh, my God!

139
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,522
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem!

140
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:35,484
-He wants to buy your baby?
-Can you believe that?

141
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,487
-That's crazy.
-That's what I told him!

142
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:42,366
-How did this even happen?
-Well, I'll tell you.

143
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:50,416
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so..

144
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:54,003
And then when we were
at the Christmas party..

145
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,757
he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

146
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,387
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby..

147
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:06,432
I figured it was
about maternity leave.

148
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:09,727
Oh. Yeah.

149
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:23,657
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

150
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:34,251
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

151
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,462
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

152
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:40,549
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

153
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,510
-We've seen each other a lot lately.
-Yes.

154
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:48,557
Maybe we'll see each other at
dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?

155
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:51,685
Well, maybe we will.

156
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,070
Mona?

157
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:30,557
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

158
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,434
Upstream.

159
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,398
Damn, nobody's here
for my good ones.

160
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:49,284
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

161
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:51,578
-It's okay.
-No, it's still wet.

162
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:56,291
Let me get it out before it sets.
I have something you could wear.

163
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:00,921
Here.

164
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:05,426
I don't know if I want to wear
a woman's shirt.

165
00:12:06,427 --> 00:12:08,887
-That's a man's shirt.
-Awfully pink.

166
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:10,889
It's not pink!

167
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,937
Honey, we are so meant
to be together.

168
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:22,568
-We both have the Annie soundtrack.
-Honey, both yours.

169
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:26,738
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

170
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,241
-The work problem?
-It was perfect.

171
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,618
It felt like he was my friend.

172
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:36,748
-What problem did you say you have?
-Oh, that's not important.

173
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:40,919
The point is,
I think everything's gonna be okay.

174
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,381
May I help you?

175
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:48,177
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

176
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:59,938
Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
It's as if someone wants us together.

177
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:02,483
Someone does. Me.

178
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,944
Witty banter. Well done. Good.

179
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:10,324
-Tell me a little bit about yourself.
-Okay. I'm a masseuse.

180
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:15,204
-And I used to work at this place..
-Do you like to party?

181
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,333
I like parties.

182
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,002
You're wild, aren't you?

183
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:28,133
-Yeah, I guess. A little.
-Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

184
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,805
So anyway..

185
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:38,310
I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess..

186
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:41,647
for, well, since I was 14.

187
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,233
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

188
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:48,487
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

189
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,449
-Oh, stop it.
-And your breasts!

190
00:13:55,536 --> 00:13:56,912
Okay.

191
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,998
Look, you're coming on
a little strong.

192
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:03,043
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

193
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,712
The universe wants us
to be together.

194
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,008
Why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.

195
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,094
-All right.
-Okay.

196
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:15,222
I write erotic novels..

197
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,974
for children.

198
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,187
-What?
-They're wildly unpopular.

199
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh, my God!

200
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:27,943
Also, you might like to know
I have a Ph.D.

201
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,029
-Wow! You do?
-Yep. A pretty huge..

202
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:32,573
All right.

203
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:50,591
-Hey.
-Joey, honey, listen.

204
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:54,386
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
It meant a lot.

205
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:56,763
Not a problem.
Just so you know..

206
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,435
that guy won't be bothering
you about that baby thing anymore.

207
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,064
-What?
-Let's just say I took care of it.

208
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,067
Let's say more.

209
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,404
Don't worry. I told him, very nicely:

210
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,450
"You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off!"

211
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,910
-What?
-What?

212
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:20,287
No, no, no!

213
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,582
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
I made that up!

214
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,959
What? Why?

215
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,296
So we would have something
to talk about!

216
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:32,257
And you couldn't think
of anything else?

217
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:35,969
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

218
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:40,599
You yelled at my boss!
I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?

219
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,602
You could always sell your baby.

220
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,774
I can't believe you brought
my boss into it! I'll be fired!

221
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,860
-You lied to me!
-Well, she told me to!

222
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,490
Chandler has two copies of Annie!

223
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,656
Oh, my God!

224
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,743
-Ross!
-Hello!

225
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,162
What are you doing?

226
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,210
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

227
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,045
Okay, then. I'll call you.

228
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,686
Morning. You wanted to see me?

229
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,730
Please, come in. Have a seat.

230
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,027
-Look, Mr. Zelner..
-It's best I speak first.

231
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,446
Yeah.

232
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:24,244
Lee from Human Resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.

233
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:25,912
Oh, God.

234
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:33,086
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby..

235
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:37,549
I am sorry. Okay?

236
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:41,303
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was..

237
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,892
I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was "due" your baby.

238
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,229
I want to be very clear..

239
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,733
that I understand
that it's your baby..

240
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,778
and it is not mine to purchase.

241
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:08,246
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.

242
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:19,883
There it is.

243
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,302
-Not your regular cleaners.
-I know.

244
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,722
That creep goes there.
I had to find a new one.

245
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:30,685
I have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store..

246
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,148
-What?
-A new grocery store.

247
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:39,653
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
I got that?

248
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,656
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

249
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:47,035
You'll meet someone. If I can meet
a great guy, so can you.

250
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:51,164
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

251
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:57,546
-You didn't have to come in.
-You kidding?

252
00:18:57,754 --> 00:19:02,676
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

253
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:07,305
I'm gonna be over here watching
the dance of the clean shirts.

254
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,645
Excuse me.
I think you dropped..

255
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,357
-Wow!
-What?

256
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,151
Sorry.
You're just so incredibly beautiful.

257
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,489
Well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

258
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:28,076
Don't think I'm crazy,
but I was meant to pick this up.

259
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:32,205
-Do you believe in that kind of thing?
-A little.

260
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,499
Now you're talking.

261
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:39,337
-Want to go for coffee?
-I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.

262
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,924
An ink stain!
Can I watch how you get this out?

263
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,219
She must have left.

264
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:53,351
-So? What happened?
-It's all gonna be okay.

265
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,607
They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
an extra month paid maternity leave.

266
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:03,028
So long as I understand the money
should not be construed..

267
00:20:03,194 --> 00:20:06,531
as a down payment on this
or any other child.

268
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,534
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way..

269
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,163
to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.

270
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,167
-Give us a minute?
-Kicking me out of my living room?

271
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,377
Yeah.

272
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,671
I'll be in there.

273
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:30,555
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things..

274
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,224
I know. I know.

275
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:35,727
It kind of worked.

276
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:40,482
I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing.

277
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,400
Yeah, you're right.

278
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:46,947
Yeah. It's kind of been
like "us" again, a little bit.

279
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:50,408
-Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
-Me too.

280
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,162
I haven't thought about
how I put myself out there..

281
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,124
and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same..

282
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,295
and how it was really awkward.

283
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:13,014
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

284
00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:22,816
Item J437-A.

285
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,986
Color: winterberry.

286
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,162
Hi, listen.
Come here. Come..

287
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,874
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

288
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,503
But what did I tell you about leaving
your key outside the door like that?

289
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,214
I mean, you're lucky it was me
and not someone else.

290
00:21:47,716 --> 00:21:50,468
I guess lucky is too strong a word.

291
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:54,472
Anyway, Mona, I'm really, really sorry.
It's just..

292
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:59,477
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

293
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:02,981
-You do?
-Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

294
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,943
To be honest,
I still have feelings for you.

295
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,946
I wish we could work it out,
but we can't.

296
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:15,285
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just..

297
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:18,538
It just wasn't meant to be.

298
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,832
Oh, God. You're right.

299
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,296
Ross, we have to be strong.

300
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,717
Okay, I'm gonna go.

301
00:22:33,178 --> 00:22:36,514
Can I? To remember you?

302
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,520
No.
