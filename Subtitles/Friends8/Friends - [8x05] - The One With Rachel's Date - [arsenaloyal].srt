1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,997
This one's rare.
This one's medium-well. Go!

2
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:07,083
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,878
Dinner was good! Just saying hi!
Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,258
-Well, hello there.
-Hi.

5
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:18,136
I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:21,347
Tim, this is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

7
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,933
-So you're Monica's boss?
-No, she's my boss.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,854
-"Sous" is French for "under."
-I "sous-stand."

9
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:33,151
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?

10
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:35,903
-You made pesto?
-Yes, I did.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,198
Would you say your pesto
is the best-o?

12
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:42,827
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

13
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,373
I still need the calamari and salad.

14
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:49,250
I like your necklace.

15
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:53,212
"Coming up, Monica. I have to obey you,
otherwise the system breaks down."

16
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,716
"I know that." "Then why are
we having this conversation? "

17
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:59,385
-I made it myself.
-You are so talented.

18
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:01,762
Well, it's no pesto.

19
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:06,225
Let's just cut to the chase.
You're single. You're single.

20
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,270
He gets off work at 11.
She'll be waiting for your call.

21
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:14,484
I'll give him your number if I could just
get one calamari and one caesar salad!

22
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:20,239
I did not yell.
I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

23
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:05,284
-Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
-You know me, sir.

24
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,580
Do you know how I can get around
the office computer network..

25
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,792
so I can access
the really good Internet porn?

26
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,212
You're a joker, Bing.

27
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:19,715
What's funny about that?

28
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:25,263
-Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
-That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

29
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,473
I think you know where I wanna go.

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,184
-The Hard Rock Cafe?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:33,020
-Again?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:38,568
-I'm telling you, I like the food.
-You like the Purple Rain display.

33
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,531
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

34
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:49,453
-Did that guy just call you Toby?
-Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

35
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:54,500
-Why don't you correct him?
-It's been going on way too long now.

36
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:58,296
The first time, we were just passing
each other, so I didn't say anything.

37
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:01,841
The next time he said,
"Toby, want a doughnut?"

38
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:04,719
I wanted the doughnut.

39
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:09,348
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

40
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,728
-Chandler, you have to tell him.
-That would be so awkward.

41
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,231
We don't work together.
He's on the sixth floor.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,401
So he calls me Toby once in a while.

43
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,321
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

44
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:28,242
Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

45
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,123
Oh, my God.

46
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:38,336
Chandler "M." Bing.

47
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,383
It's not just an "M."
Your middle name is Muriel!

48
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:47,261
It is a family name.

49
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,265
Chandler Muriel Bing.

50
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:56,062
Your parents never even
gave you a chance, did they?

51
00:03:57,146 --> 00:04:00,316
Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your memory loss.

52
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,567
What is it?

53
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,737
Your brain transplant
wasn't successful.

54
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,782
Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

55
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,159
Is it serious?

56
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,870
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body..

57
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:19,001
and synthesize antibodies
to stop you from rejecting the brain.

58
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,880
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.

59
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,926
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body..

60
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,428
it was gone.

61
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:35,101
Very nice, people.

62
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,436
I'll change and we can go.

63
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:42,191
-What happened to Jessica's body?
-You'll have to see it on TV.

64
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:45,444
-You don't know, do you?
-Couldn't care less.

65
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,615
-Good scene, man.
-You too.

66
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,037
What? You weren't in it.

67
00:04:56,664 --> 00:05:00,209
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash.

68
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:04,338
-Hi.
-Why haven't I seen you here before?

69
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:10,469
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

70
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,972
Which I'm not.
I'm not.

71
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:18,519
Although, I do know your favorite
ice cream flavor is butter pecan.

72
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:23,190
And your dog's name is Wally.

73
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,736
-Look, I'm just stroking your arm.
-Here we go.

74
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,989
Bye, Kash.
Say hi to Wally.

75
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,370
-Monica.
-Hi.

76
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:41,584
I had the best time
with Tim last night. He is so sweet.

77
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,503
I can't wait
to get "sous-neath" him.

78
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,466
-I have to fire him.
-Why?

79
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:52,011
He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.

80
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,972
He lit my pastry chef on fire.

81
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,476
He was nervous.
You can be intimidating.

82
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:02,521
And your pastry chef can stand
to be taken down a peg.

83
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,400
Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.

84
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:09,904
But, Monica, he loves his job so much.

85
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:13,866
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?

86
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,454
All right. But if he lights
someone else on fire, he's gone.

87
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,333
That's fair. Thank you so much.

88
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,253
Looks like he got you
a little bit too.

89
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,548
I paid to have this done.

90
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,886
Love it!

91
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:41,018
Hey. You know,
Kash really liked you.

92
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,312
He thought you were charming.

93
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:47,566
-I thought I was an idiot.
-I'm with you.

94
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:54,115
-He asked if you'd go out with him.
-I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

95
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:56,450
-What did you say?
-"No."

96
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,536
What?

97
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:03,916
I figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.

98
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:09,588
First of all, Kash Ford?
Not people.

99
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:12,341
Did you tell him I was pregnant?

100
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:18,347
No. I didn't know if you told people.
This was when Kash was still "people."

101
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:22,351
-Good. Just have him call me.
-I don't think that's..

102
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:27,273
Go do it or I'll come back
to that set. I'll meet more actors.

103
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,695
-Hey, Bob.
-How's my pal Toby doing today?

104
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:35,823
If I see him, I'll ask.

105
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:42,454
Was that Bob from six
you were just talking to?

106
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,373
-Yeah.
-You know him?

107
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,084
We're on a semi-first-name basis.

108
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:52,131
-What about adding him to our team?
-Bob?

109
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:58,304
Working here with us? Every day?
I don't know if he has what it takes.

110
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:02,308
-They love him down on six.
-But this is 11.

111
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,686
It's almost twice as hard up here.

112
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:09,857
-Okay, Bob will stay put.
-I think it's best, sir.

113
00:08:10,107 --> 00:08:13,777
We do need to find somebody.
Work is starting to pile up.

114
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:17,156
I've got a stack
of documents this high.

115
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:21,744
Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.

116
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,914
That's a good one, Bing.

117
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:30,002
What does a guy have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

118
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,636
I gave him another chance,
but Tim has got to go.

119
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:42,348
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

120
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:45,893
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

121
00:08:46,185 --> 00:08:48,896
-But don't fire him today.
-Why?

122
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:53,067
-Because I'm dumping him today.
-You said he was sweet.

123
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:57,071
He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.

124
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:00,866
"Did you get home okay?
Was your shower okay?"

125
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:03,827
-Don't pick up the phone.
-Then he comes over!

126
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:07,414
"I was so worried about you."
Be a man!

127
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,959
So I can't fire him?

128
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,420
And dump him the same day?
He'll kill himself.

129
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,090
I'll fire him, and you go out
with him another week.

130
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:20,177
Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.

131
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:23,681
We'll both do it today
and he'll just have to deal with it.

132
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,104
Okay. But who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.

133
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:33,482
-What?
-Fire a guy that's just been dumped?

134
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:37,319
Bitch!
And dump a guy that's just been fired?

135
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,446
Blond bitch!

136
00:09:39,697 --> 00:09:44,118
I wanted to do this days ago,
so I think I should go first.

137
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,745
All right, that makes sense.

138
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,958
But screw you! I'm going first!

139
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:57,715
-Toby, you got a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

140
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:02,845
I wanted to get transferred up here,
but it's not gonna happen.

141
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:07,433
Apparently somebody thinks
I'm not "11th-floor material."

142
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,812
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

143
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:17,776
What's the best excuse for why
I'm not drinking on this date tonight?

144
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:20,988
"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"..

145
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,617
or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?

146
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,703
You're not gonna
tell him you're pregnant?

147
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,457
I don't think so. Books say wait
till the third date to tell the guy..

148
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,709
you got something
growing in your uterus.

149
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,545
-Hey.
-Hi.

150
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,298
What do you want to do tonight?

151
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:43,635
There's a powerful Ukrainian film
playing. Interested?

152
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:48,223
No. But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.

153
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:52,561
-Rach, you wanna come?
-I can't. I've got a date.

154
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,440
-A date?
-Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

155
00:10:56,648 --> 00:11:01,445
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's regular.

156
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:05,824
It's mundane.
It's actually a little dull.

157
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,952
It's no Ukrainian film.

158
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,330
Earrings!

159
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,795
-She's got a date? With who?
-I set her up with this actor.

160
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:22,716
-You set her up?
-No.

161
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:26,178
-What were you thinking?
-That it was okay..

162
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:29,306
because you two haven't dated
in five years.

163
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:34,895
I'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

164
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:41,360
-Where is this "actor" taking them?
-Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

165
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,240
They're taking the ferry
to a place on Staten Island.

166
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:52,621
My baby's going on a ferry? Do you
have any idea how dangerous those are?

167
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,959
Aren't we talking about
those big boats that go really slow?

168
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:03,090
Why not just jump out of an airplane
or burn each other with matches?

169
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:10,764
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.

170
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:14,351
Hey, I hear you're going
on a ferry tonight.

171
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,895
Bit of a daredevil, are we?

172
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:22,067
Do you guys think this is too slutty?
Hi, Kash.

173
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:27,030
-Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
-Yeah. See you guys later.

174
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:32,035
Have a great time, you guys.
And yes, it is too slutty!

175
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,251
Hi.

176
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,211
Hi.

177
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:45,507
I'm glad you called.
I feel like I'm always calling you.

178
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,760
What's up?
Is everything okay with Phoebe?

179
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:53,473
It will be in a minute.

180
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:58,395
-Tim, you're a really great guy.
-That's because I'm with you.

181
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:06,069
It's just, I'm in a place in my life
right now where..

182
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,282
So sorry. "This just in."

183
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:14,119
It's the restaurant.
Monica needs me right away.

184
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,998
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

185
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,126
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

186
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:26,131
And I will be holding you right here.

187
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:38,018
What movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read.

188
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:40,312
I get that from books.

189
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:44,858
-Books?
-Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes..

190
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,443
but it's enough!

191
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:51,865
Let's not see a movie.
We'll just stay here and hang.

192
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:58,455
-Just wait for Rachel to come back?
-Hey, if that's what you wanna do.

193
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,208
Dude, what is going on?

194
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,753
-I have to find out how it went.
-Why?

195
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,259
-He could be my baby's stepfather.
-One date and they're getting married?

196
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:12,844
He's not you!

197
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:16,890
I can't believe she's dating!

198
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:21,436
-What did you think she was gonna do?
-I don't know.

199
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:26,358
-I can't believe this is happening.
-What do you mean?

200
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:30,988
I thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.

201
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:37,286
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's..

202
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:40,372
it breaks my heart a little.

203
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:45,377
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed..

204
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:51,466
my kid comes running in, leaps up
on the bed and we all read the paper.

205
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,970
Maybe fight over the science section.

206
00:14:55,637 --> 00:15:01,893
-That's nice. You can still have that.
-No. Rachel's out with some guy.

207
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,022
My baby went with her.

208
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:10,193
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.

209
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,322
Hey, can I ask you something?

210
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:19,828
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?

211
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:23,123
It used to be.

212
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,711
Now she doesn't really have a face.

213
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,214
Smokin' body, though.

214
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,929
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.

215
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:42,184
No. But how much easier would it be
if it were?

216
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,519
That's not what she wants.

217
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:48,774
I know. And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her.

218
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,319
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.

219
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,448
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what..

220
00:15:56,657 --> 00:16:01,328
there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

221
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,040
Who cares what the picture looks like?

222
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:07,125
Yeah.

223
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:11,338
Let's you and me go out
and have some fun.

224
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,216
Whatever you want. Come on.

225
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:19,471
-We can catch that Ukrainian film.
-No, I said fun.

226
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,183
-Hey, Toby?
-Hey, Bobby.

227
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:26,311
It's Bob, actually.

228
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,733
You work up here. Where's
Chandler Bing's office?

229
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:35,695
Yeah, it's right..

230
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,699
Right there.
Let me ask you, why?

231
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:42,369
I wanna talk to that bastard,
see what his problem is.

232
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:44,621
Okay, Bob. Listen.

233
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm the reason you didn't get the job.

234
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,211
-Toby, don't.
-Bob.

235
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,007
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover
for him.

236
00:16:56,216 --> 00:17:00,554
Anything you say will just get me
more upset with Chandler.

237
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:04,141
That puts me
in a difficult position.

238
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,186
You do anything to Chandler,
it's gonna bring you down to his level.

239
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,191
I guess you're right.

240
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,696
Don't give him the satisfaction.
You're better than Chandler. We all are.

241
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,365
Especially me, Toby.

242
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,581
-Is everything okay?
-That depends.

243
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:31,877
-How are you and Phoebe?
-Great. Thanks for introducing us.

244
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:37,174
My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

245
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:39,384
-Phoebe!
-Monica!

246
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,722
-You're fired!
-I'm breaking up with you!

247
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,891
I'm breaking up with you.

248
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,352
-You're fired.
-Why?

249
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:53,732
I'm sorry. I'm not ready
for a relationship right now.

250
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:58,361
I'm sorry too.
But I like things done a certain way.

251
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:03,909
-The chemistry's just not right.
-The chemistry thing for us too.

252
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,289
Wow. Okay.

253
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:16,755
I realize I came on a little strong.
It's because I think you're amazing.

254
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:23,261
I wanna tell you how much I appreciate
you giving me an opportunity.

255
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,015
You're the most talented chef
I've ever worked for.

256
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,518
Anyway..

257
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,068
-Tim, wait.
-Yeah?

258
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,115
I spoke too quickly. There's
a learning curve with this job.

259
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,952
Maybe we could try it again.

260
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:50,789
Thank you so much.
I know I can be better.

261
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:56,795
And, Tim, I just want to say
good luck here.

262
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,179
-Hello.
-Hi.

263
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,807
How was the date?

264
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:14,563
I'm alone and I just bought $15 worth
of candy bars. What do you think?

265
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:19,192
-What happened?
-I told him I was pregnant.

266
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:24,155
-He didn't take it so well?
-Well, better than you.

267
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:27,617
-But still not what you want.
-Oh?

268
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,454
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said:

269
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,666
"I hear those hemorrhoids
are a bitch."

270
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,878
-He sounds swell.
-Doesn't he?

271
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:43,341
You want a little cheering up?
Sit down.

272
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:47,888
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.

273
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,229
Chandler M. Bing.
Oh, my God.

274
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,153
-I'm sorry about your date.
-It's all right.

275
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,823
I guess I'm just done
with the dating thing.

276
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:11,494
Just one more thing in my life
that's completely different.

277
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:15,665
-This is hard.
-Yeah, I know.

278
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:23,715
On the other hand, in seven months
you're gonna have something..

279
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:29,846
that you're gonna love more than
any guy you've ever gone out with.

280
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,933
Just wait.

281
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:38,647
Wait until the first time
your baby grabs your finger.

282
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,274
You have no idea.

283
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,236
Thanks, sweetie.

284
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:54,913
-You wanna grab some coffee?
-No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.

285
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:59,876
-I thought I cheered you up.
-You did. There are 20 in here.

286
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,213
-Good night.
-Good night.

287
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,307
Ross? Hey, it's Mona.
From the wedding.

288
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:17,185
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

289
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:22,440
-How are you?
-I'm good, except you owe me a dance.

290
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:28,488
That's right. Well, would you be
interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?

291
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,617
Oh, you're serious. Sure.

292
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:35,745
Great. Well..

293
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:42,502
-I think I need another cup of coffee.
-Sure, let me get it for you.

294
00:21:58,393 --> 00:21:59,519
Bob?

295
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:01,187
Bob!

296
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,148
Bob!

297
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,528
-What the hell are you doing?
-This is Chandler's office.

298
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,823
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
