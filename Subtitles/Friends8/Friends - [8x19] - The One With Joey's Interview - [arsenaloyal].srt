1
00:00:00,622 --> 00:00:05,521
Hi. So I'm doing the Soap Opera
Digest crossword puzzle...

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,485
...and guess who is the clue
for three down?

3
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:13,285
"Days of Our Lives star,
blank Tribbiani."

4
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:16,376
That's me! I'm blank!

5
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:21,003
How cool! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.

6
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,878
Yeah, you are, baby.

7
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:27,023
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?

8
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:29,846
Do they call to tell you you're in it?

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,766
No. They wanted to do
a profile on me. I said no.

10
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,410
Why'd you say no?

11
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,231
Remember the last interview I did?

12
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:41,914
I said I write my own lines,
the writers got mad...

13
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:46,848
...and I fell down an elevator shaft.
Who knows what I'd say now?

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,695
If only there was something
in your head to control what you say.

15
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,000
Come on, you'll keep it
in check this time.

16
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:59,587
The publicity would be good for you.
You deserve that.

17
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:05,367
In the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

18
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:09,741
Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

19
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:15,524
- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
- Fine, all right, I'll do it.

20
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:19,970
You have to be there to stop me
if I say something stupid.

21
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:24,982
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?

22
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:29,477
We'll be there the whole time.
Just remember:

23
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,949
Gal pal, Rachel Green.

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,633
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword.

25
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:42,100
Seriously, proud of you.

26
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:48,090
The One With Joeys Interview

27
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:27,261
- Thanks for taking the time for this.
- Not at all. Happy to do it.

28
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:29,766
You think we're being obvious?

29
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:35,225
No. We're just four people with
neck problems, who talk like this.

30
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,591
It's great that we met here.

31
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:43,860
When people hear the magazine's paying,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.

32
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:47,862
Actually, I didn't know
the magazine was paying.

33
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:53,004
Wouldn't have mattered. I do this
for the fans, not the free food.

34
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,690
- Can I get you anything?
- Coffee.

35
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,961
And I'll have all the muffins.

36
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,214
- Hey.
- We're not talking.

37
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:06,715
Oh, finally.

38
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:12,875
According to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work.

39
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,459
Anything that you're
particularly proud of?

40
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:21,883
All you want is a dingle

41
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,089
What you envy's a shwang

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,597
A thing through which you can tinkle

43
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,839
Or play with, or simply let hang

44
00:03:46,524 --> 00:03:49,858
This ever happen?
You want a glass of milk...

45
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,298
...but these darn cartons
are so hard to open!

46
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,355
Boy, you said it, Mike.

47
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,647
- There's gotta be a better way!
- There is, Kevin!

48
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:06,279
This is the first time
he's ever used this. It's easy.

49
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,217
- This works in any milk carton.
- It is easy.

50
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,936
Now I can have milk every day.

51
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,028
So this is it, Victor?

52
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:22,180
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...

53
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:27,262
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

54
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:38,638
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7
in search of alternative fuels.

55
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:45,421
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.

56
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,208
But I won't have aged at all.

57
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:56,383
So you tell your great-great-
granddaughter to look me up.

58
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:00,560
Because, Adrian...

59
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,607
...baby...

60
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,675
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

61
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:18,160
Here I come.
I'm coming to fix the copier.

62
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:22,893
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

63
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:29,292
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:

64
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:32,805
You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

65
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:37,958
- Nice work, my friend.
- Wait, you see me again.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,265
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

67
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,606
There I am. There I am. There I am.

68
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,611
There are so many things,
it's hard to pick just one.

69
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,981
I'm getting coffee. Want anything?

70
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:57,365
- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
- Double latte.

71
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,131
- A bagel with only...
- I was just being polite.

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,495
How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?

73
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,175
Look at this clown. He thinks
he can take up the whole river.

74
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,863
Get out of the way, jackass!

75
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:22,311
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

76
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:25,588
That is the Coast Guard.

77
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:30,391
What are they doing out here?
The coast is way over there!

78
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,032
This is unbelievable.

79
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:38,109
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

80
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,965
Dude, are you trying to kill me?

81
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, I see you've had
a very productive day.

82
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:58,736
- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
- Come on, it's fun!

83
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,719
All right.

84
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,447
Isn't this a woman's hat?

85
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,141
Dude, stop talking crazy
and make us some tea.

86
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,928
We have to turn off the porn.

87
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,273
I think you're right.

88
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,399
- All right, ready?
- One.

89
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:29,357
- Two, three.
- Three.

90
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,311
That's kind of nice.

91
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,847
- It's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

92
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:47,629
- You wanna see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

93
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:51,065
Free porn! We have free porn here!

94
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:54,623
In my spare time, I read to the blind.

95
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:58,199
And I'm also a mento for kids.

96
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,447
- A mento?
- You know, a mento. A role model.

97
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,426
- A mento?
- Right.

98
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:11,182
- Like the candy?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

99
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:19,316
Our readers always want to know how
soap stars stay in such great shape.

100
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,966
Do you have a fitness regime?

101
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:26,971
We stars usually just try to eat right
and get lots of exercise.

102
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:31,948
You know we've thrown this
without dropping it for an hour?

103
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,409
Are you serious?

104
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,773
I realized it a half-hour ago,
but I didn't want to jinx it.

105
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:42,599
- Wow, we are pretty good at this.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,657
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.

107
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:47,603
That's the first time
I've ever missed a meal.

108
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:50,564
My pants are a little loose.

109
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,123
What's wrong with you?

110
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,306
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights.

111
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:03,222
And then I passed out.

112
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:08,648
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's serious.

113
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:12,273
Sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

114
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:13,801
No way!

115
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:19,689
If I go to the doctor, it's for this
thing sticking out of my stomach!

116
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:25,072
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

117
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,934
Damn you, fifteens!

118
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,097
- What is it?
- A trifle. It has layers.

119
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,677
A layer of ladyfingers,
then a layer of jam.

120
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:38,118
Then custard,
which I made from scratch.

121
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:43,199
Raspberries, more ladyfingers,
beef sautéed with peas and onions.

122
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,299
Then a little bit more custard.

123
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,469
It tastes like feet.

124
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,815
I like it.

125
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:00,602
- Are you kidding?
- What's not to like? Custard, good.

126
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,837
Jam, good. Meat, good!

127
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:09,262
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

128
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:14,378
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

129
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:17,223
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

130
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:20,077
Hey, what was in that brown jar?

131
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:23,249
- That's still in there?
- Not anymore.

132
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,274
This piece doesn't have floor on it.

133
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,131
- Stick to your side.
- Hey, come on, now.

134
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:43,324
All right, what are we having?

135
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:52,644
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.

136
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,629
Your muffins.

137
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,775
I'll take those to go.

138
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,372
For the kids.

139
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,577
I know what I wanted to ask.

140
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,792
They killed you off years ago.
What happened there?

141
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,286
I said some stuff in an interview
I shouldn't have said.

142
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:18,711
- But that is not gonna happen today.
- Understood.

143
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:22,881
- So, what'd you say back then?
- I said that I...

144
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:26,048
- Hey, Joey!
- How you doing?

145
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:33,035
This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.
Shelly, these are my friends.

146
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,401
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
If you want the dirt, come to me.

147
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:42,468
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?

148
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:47,233
I'm just kidding.
Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.

149
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,648
Who just lost the respect
of her unborn child.

150
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:54,643
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.

151
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:58,891
- You're doing great.
- So far, nothing stupid.

152
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,122
- Mento?
- No, thanks.

153
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,356
As Joey's friends, is there anything
our readers should know?

154
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,557
No, just that he is a great guy.

155
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,758
That'll get you
into Soap Opera Digest.

156
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:16,394
Well, I...

157
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,753
I'd like to say that Joey...

158
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:23,657
...truly has enriched
the days of our lives.

159
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,672
I think that you don't expect
someone so hot to be so sweet.

160
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,476
- I like that. What's your name?
- Phoebe Buffay.

161
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:38,930
- How do you spell that?
- It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.

162
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:41,404
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.

163
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:46,662
B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"

164
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,718
Great. It was nice meeting you.

165
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:52,746
- Yeah, you too.
- Thanks.

166
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,039
It seems you have a lot of friends.
Who is your best friend?

167
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,334
How come you have two?

168
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,462
Well, this one's for you.

169
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:10,525
- Get out!
- No, I can't.

170
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:17,035
I know how much this means to you.
This isn't just about jewelry.

171
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:22,490
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.

172
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:27,536
Is this friendship? I think so!

173
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,670
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!

174
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,422
That's what they'll call us!

175
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:39,506
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

176
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:42,190
That's gonna leave a stain.

177
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:46,399
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

178
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,591
- Really?
- Yeah, look.

179
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,469
- I've never lived like this before.
- I know!

180
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:06,126
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

181
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:09,852
I feel guilty.
I wanna be a good friend...

182
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:14,818
...and damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

183
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:22,087
You are a good friend.

184
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,128
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

185
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:32,108
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.

186
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:38,722
Let's get the contestants
out of their isolation booths.

187
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,777
And they're off!

188
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,293
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge!

189
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,114
Judge rules: No violation.

190
00:14:47,706 --> 00:14:53,056
- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
- No! That's just an old won ton.

191
00:14:53,377 --> 00:14:56,923
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

192
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,386
Tough call.

193
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:05,579
- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.
- Wait a minute. I saw that!

194
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:08,786
Yeah, about jellyfish,
and how if you...

195
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,774
You peed on yourself?

196
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,471
You can't say that! You don't know!

197
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,783
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

198
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:28,512
Anyway, I tried,
but I couldn't bend that way.

199
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,893
So...

200
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,763
That's right, I stepped up!

201
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,990
She's my friend and she needed help!

202
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:50,841
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you!

203
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:57,114
Nope. No best friend.

204
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,276
Just a lot of close friends.

205
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,794
So now back to the show.

206
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,203
How does it feel
to have a huge gay fan base?

207
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,569
Really? Me?

208
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:15,057
Wow, I don't even know
any huge gay people.

209
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:18,893
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.

210
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:23,652
Now, off the record, you're not...

211
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:27,965
What? Are you referring
to my man's bag?

212
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:32,181
At first, it just looked good,
but it's practical.

213
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,533
It's got compartments for stuff:
Your wallet, your keys.

214
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,925
Your makeup.

215
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:43,732
Should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

216
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,509
...or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?

217
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,465
- I think face is best.
- Yeah, face.

218
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,882
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

219
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:03,138
Oh, my...
How much do you weigh, Ross?

220
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:08,635
I prefer not to answer that. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

221
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:21,862
When we said "face to face," we didn't
think it all the way through!

222
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:24,092
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

223
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,545
Check it out.

224
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,264
How much of a man am I?

225
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:41,033
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.

226
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,639
You're turning into a woman.

227
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,212
No, I'm not! Why would you say that?
That's just mean!

228
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,171
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

229
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:57,208
Not what you said,
it's just the way you said it.

230
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,519
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!

231
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,939
- Great nap.
- It really was.

232
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,659
Me? Gay? No. No. No.

233
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:32,456
But I have a number
of close friends who are.

234
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,014
So let's talk about women.

235
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:41,151
I'm sure our female readers are
interested in your romantic life.

236
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:45,150
What I do is, I look a woman
up and down and I say:

237
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:49,081
"Hey. How you doing?"

238
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:52,767
Oh, please.

239
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,975
Hey. How you doing?

240
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:03,207
Hey. How you doing?

241
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,378
He has an amazing Porsche under there.

242
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,179
I'd love to show you, but I just
tucked her in. She's sleeping.

243
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:14,797
Would you two girls
like to go for a drink?

244
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:24,053
- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
- Oh, my God! Jill!

245
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,352
- Oh, my God! Rachel!
- Oh, hi!

246
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:30,795
- Oh, my God! Introduce us!
- Well, this is Chandler.

247
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,904
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.

248
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:38,346
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't!

249
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,007
You're a really nice guy. I'm happy
to be your roommate and friend.

250
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:51,366
I'm just... You know, I just
don't feel that way about you.

251
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,272
I see what happened.

252
00:19:56,517 --> 00:20:00,064
It's because I was trying
to repel you. Right?

253
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,731
Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

254
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,828
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do.

255
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,136
How you doing?

256
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,006
I'm okay.

257
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:20,346
What? Oh, dear God!

258
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:27,860
Not much to tell there.
I'm really shy.

259
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,214
So that's it.
I guess that's all I need.

260
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:37,559
Thank you so much.
I think they'll run this next month.

261
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,839
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.

262
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,516
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

263
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,988
- I did it.
- Amazing.

264
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,442
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:

265
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:55,136
Other than Days,
what's your favorite soap opera?

266
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:01,150
Oh, I don't watch soap operas.
Excuse me? I have a life, you know?

267
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:07,486
The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.

268
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,360
Good enough.

269
00:21:13,128 --> 00:21:14,753
So close.

270
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:23,520
They didn't put in the part
about you not watching soaps.

271
00:21:23,774 --> 00:21:28,401
I called the lady and said I
was joking. She was nice about it.

272
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:31,872
- You slept with her, didn't you?
- A little bit.

273
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:36,051
This picture of you is steamy.

274
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,677
That's just a little something
for my huge gay fan base.

275
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:44,083
- Did you just wink at me?
- You're the one who loves the picture.
