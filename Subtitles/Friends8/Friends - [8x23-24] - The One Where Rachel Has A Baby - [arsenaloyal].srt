1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,124
All right!

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:10,044
Yes! From home to the hospital
in under seven minutes! We did it.

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:13,548
Yes, the hard part is truly over.

4
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,009
No, but come on, we're off
to a great start, aren't we?

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:20,888
I knew I'd get here fast, but this
has gotta be some kind of a record!

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,267
-Oh, you made it!
-Hi.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,439
-How the hell did you beat us here?
-We took a cab. Did you guys walk?

8
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:33,359
No, we took a cab too.
But I did test runs..

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,153
Hey, you made it!

10
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:40,241
Okay, is there some kind of magic
tunnel to this hospital?

11
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:44,579
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.

12
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:49,792
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.

13
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:53,045
Right. We have a semi-private
labor room waiting for you, so..

14
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:58,676
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?
We asked for a private room.

15
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:03,139
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately,
we can't guarantee a private room.

16
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:08,936
-And, currently, they're all unavailable.
-Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

17
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,774
I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms
are all we have.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,652
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

19
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,155
Yeah?

20
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:23,618
-Give her some money.
-I really think they're out of rooms.

21
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,787
They're not, Ross. They're just
saving them for important people!

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,623
Okay? What if I was the president?

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,795
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.

24
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:35,922
Okay.

25
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:40,176
Say, would you mind checking again?

26
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,722
See if any private rooms
may have opened up?

27
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,767
This is a hospital.

28
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:52,897
Okay, I see.
Could we please talk to the manager?

29
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:54,899
There is no manager.

30
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:58,653
Just nurses, doctors
and semi-private rooms.

31
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,281
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.

32
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:08,371
And this is not the only hospital in this
city, and we have no problem.. Oh, gosh!

33
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,331
-What? What?
-Contraction!

34
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,507
-Would you like to see a semi-private room?
-Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,630
Well, you're only two centimeters
dilated, and we need to get to 10.

36
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,008
-It'll be a while.
-Oh, okay.

37
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:05,303
-I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
-Thank you.

38
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:08,139
Oh, wait, Dr. Long.
Can I ask you something?

39
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,559
Is labor really as painful
as everybody says it is?

40
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:14,312
Oh, look at that.
My beeper's going crazy.

41
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,608
Hey, don't.. You know what?
You're gonna be fine.

42
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:24,572
-I guess we have some time to kill.
-Yeah, guess so.

43
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:27,617
Oh, check these out.

44
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,044
Never done this before.

45
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:42,673
Doesn't feel good.

46
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,761
Yeah, well, it looks great.

47
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:51,098
Thank you very much.
I think we're ready to..

48
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:02,526
Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin
this magical day for you.

49
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:06,072
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.

50
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:09,408
-Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
-Oh, hi, Rachel.

51
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,786
-Is this your first?
-Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:14,705
Well, little Jamie here is our third.

53
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:18,334
So if you have any questions, or
you need anything at all, just holler.

54
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,504
-That's so sweet.
-Yeah.

55
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:28,511
-Let me give you guys some privacy.
-Nonsense. We're all in this together.

56
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:32,098
We are gonna share every
moment of this with you.

57
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:36,102
-I think we're gonna have some fun.
-Yeah.

58
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:38,437
-Oh, okay, I guess.
-Hey, smile!

59
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:40,648
-I don't know if..
-I really don't want any..

60
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:41,982
Oh, thank you.

61
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:46,487
Oh, Ross!
Here comes another contraction.

62
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,823
Okay, just breathe.

63
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,576
-Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
-Oh, my God!

64
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,499
Hey, look at this.

65
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,751
-Here you go!
-Oh, no!

66
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,430
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

67
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:17,184
The miracle of birth
sure is a snooze-fest.

68
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:23,023
-Hey, you wanna see something?
-Sure. What?

69
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:26,402
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.

70
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,696
-Honey?
-Yeah?

71
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:31,991
Listen, I've been doing
some thinking..

72
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:36,245
and I don't know whether
it's because we're here..

73
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:39,165
or Rachel's giving birth..

74
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:43,294
but I think we should
try to have a baby.

75
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:48,841
Okay.

76
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,470
What's that now?

77
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:56,891
Okay. I've been thinking about it too,
and I think we're ready.

78
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,897
Are you kidding? You think
we're ready to have a baby now?

79
00:06:03,105 --> 00:06:04,523
This is fun.

80
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:10,529
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!

81
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,364
You said you were ready too.

82
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,786
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you to
try to get your voice all high and weird..

83
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:18,329
Like mine is now!

84
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,540
Yes, but haven't you
wanted a kid, like, forever?

85
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:25,127
Yeah, but no one ever wanted
to have one with me. I mean..

86
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:29,381
Now I'm just gonna have a baby if I
want to. Oh, what are you doing to me?

87
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,885
I'm sorry I brought it up.

88
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:36,680
Okay, then, back off, mister!

89
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,061
Because I am ready to have a baby.

90
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,772
I just want Joey to be the father.

91
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:50,319
-What? Are you crazy?
-That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!

92
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:56,784
I am sorry. The doctor insisted
on closing the curtain for the exam.

93
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,246
Oh, that's very..
Really, very, very okay.

94
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:06,127
Julie's cervix is dilated seven
centimeters. That's about four fingers!

95
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:10,214
-Doctor let me feel it myself.
-Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?

96
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,676
-No, I don't.. We're not gonna do that.
-We won't be doing that.

97
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:18,305
Well, if you like, you could feel
Rachel's, then feel mine to compare.

98
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:23,269
-Am I interrupting?
-Yes! Thank you! Later.

99
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,105
-No, you can't leave me alone with them.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:31,277
No, Ross? Ross? Ross?
My child has no father!

101
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:37,074
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna
be a while. I wish you'd called first.

102
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:39,869
That's all right.
I'm coming back later with your father.

103
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:44,206
-I needed to talk to you before the birth.
-Okay. What's up?

104
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:47,418
Ross, I want to talk
to you as your mother..

105
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:51,380
even though I know that you and I
are also very close friends.

106
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:57,094
I really don't know what
you're talking about, but okay.

107
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,847
I brought something
that I want to give you.

108
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,684
Assuming, of course, that you want it.

109
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,521
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?

110
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:13,027
This is your grandmother's engagement
ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.

111
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,697
-Mom, no. Come on. Thank you.
-Just hear me out..

112
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:18,532
No! Okay? We've been through this.

113
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,702
We're not gonna get married
just because she's pregnant. Okay?

114
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:28,125
Honestly, Ross, this isn't just some girl
you picked up in a bar and humped.

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,216
You think young people use
that word more than we actually do.

116
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,552
Ross, a child should have a family.

117
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,472
You know what? I can't deal
with this right now. I'm sorry.

118
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,098
Go.. Hey, go talk to Monica.

119
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,893
She got a new haircut.
You'll hate it.

120
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:51,023
Just think about it. If you don't,
I'll talk more about humping.

121
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,067
Give me.

122
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,071
-Hi, dear.
-Hi. Thank you so much for coming.

123
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,157
Ross, get in here!

124
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:06,997
You wanna see something funny?

125
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,124
Monica.

126
00:09:11,043 --> 00:09:13,879
Okay. All right, stop it.
You're freaking me out.

127
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:15,798
Do it again. Do it again.

128
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:18,926
Hey, Rachel had the baby.

129
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:20,594
-What?
-Really?

130
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,762
No.

131
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:26,016
I don't know why
I thought that'd be funny.

132
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,687
You said hi to Mom
before she left, right?

133
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,939
I thought that was her.

134
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:35,317
Yeah, I called her name,
and she ducked into a stairwell.

135
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,653
Well, you know what?
Consider yourself lucky.

136
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,407
She pulled me out of the labor room
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.

137
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:43,075
-Oh, my God.
-How annoying.

138
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,702
Yeah.

139
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,207
-Why aren't you with Rachel?
-You're kidding, right?

140
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:54,336
Look, we're not gonna be together
just because we're having this baby.

141
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,797
And I know she's not
just some girl I humped..

142
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,425
Oh, humped?

143
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,635
Come on, Ross.

144
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,889
But it just seems that
you two belong together.

145
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:10,060
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this
right now. I have to go have a baby.

146
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:12,855
Right. And with who again?

147
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:17,401
He's crazy. Why doesn't
he wanna be with Rachel?

148
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:18,652
I know.

149
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:23,240
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down..

150
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:25,826
but if she hadn't
and she wanted to be with me..

151
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,746
I would take her in my arms and..

152
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,961
I haven't bummed you guys out
like this in a while, have I?

153
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,133
-Hey.
-Hey.

154
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,927
-Who's that?
-New people.

155
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:48,557
What happened to the Disgustingtons?

156
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:54,104
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!

157
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,940
Right after you left,
they wheeled her off into delivery.

158
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:03,280
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice,
juicy shot of little Jamie crowning away.

159
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,074
Wow. Sorry.

160
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,910
So how are the new people?

161
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:11,830
Well, they have some unusual
pet names for each other.

162
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:17,294
Including "Evil Bitch"
and "Sick Bastard."

163
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:23,384
-Oh, gosh, a contraction.
-Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.

164
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:25,594
-Are you looking at her?
-No!

165
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:31,016
-Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
-Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!

166
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:36,480
She's in labor. You like that,
you sick son of a bitch?

167
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,484
I'm just gonna..

168
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:44,488
See? It's because you were looking,
you fat pervert.

169
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:50,244
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.

170
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,124
You miss your girlfriend?

171
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,669
Just ignore them.

172
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,338
-You okay?
-Yeah.

173
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,432
-Ross.
-What?

174
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,269
-He's looking at me.
-Hey!

175
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,354
You wanna live to see your baby?

176
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:21,859
Don't you talk to my husband like that,
you stupid bastard!

177
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:32,578
Oh, good God! If you want
a baby so bad, just go steal it!

178
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:36,081
Oh, don't worry.
These babies are far too ugly for us.

179
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,044
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?

180
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:45,549
I'm not crazy about babies.
I'm crazy about us.

181
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:48,302
What?

182
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:52,306
We've always talked about having
babies someday, not now..

183
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:57,728
but I'm starting to think that we
can handle it. We're good.

184
00:12:57,895 --> 00:13:00,606
We're really good.

185
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,066
We are pretty good.

186
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,403
But nothing has to happen
until you're ready.

187
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:10,157
Well, maybe I'm ready now.

188
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:14,328
I mean, it's a little scary,
but maybe it's right.

189
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:17,581
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!

190
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:22,002
-What?
-I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.

191
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:27,633
So we're gonna try?
I mean, we're trying?

192
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,552
We're trying to get pregnant.

193
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,352
I'm not comfortable doing
this in front of the babies.

194
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,941
-So when do you want to start trying?
-All right, hold on a sec.

195
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,985
-Period math?
-Yeah.

196
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:51,865
Well, we could start trying now.

197
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:56,745
-Right here?
-No, not here.

198
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:59,289
Maybe here.

199
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:03,669
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
and we're in a building that's full of beds!

200
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,088
And it's so clean!

201
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,638
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!

202
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:18,684
-It ate your money?
-No.

203
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:25,774
-I'll see you downstairs then.
-All right.

204
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,236
Hey, I got one! I got one!

205
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,115
-Hi.
-Hi.

206
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:36,910
-Oh, up or down?
-Oh. Down, please.

207
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:43,417
I hate to be a ball-buster,
but can I just do it?

208
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,672
-Could you press up too?
-Sure.

209
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:54,511
-I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.
-Yeah? How'd yours happen?

210
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,139
Well, it's a long story,
it's kind of embarrassing.

211
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:02,519
Let's just say there was a
typographical error with a sex manual.

212
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,188
-How about you?
-Car accident.

213
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:08,233
Some idiot on a cell phone
wasn't paying attention?

214
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,235
Yeah. Me.

215
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,280
-Sorry.
-Oh, no. No, don't be.

216
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:16,533
Nobody else got hurt.
And I was pretty lucky.

217
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,869
Well, I, for one, am glad you made it.

218
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:22,748
Are you sure?
I mean, you don't know me.

219
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:25,959
I could have been sent
from another planet to destroy Earth.

220
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,795
Couldn't press the "down" button.
I think Earth's okay.

221
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,842
Oh, hey, that's me.

222
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,721
Hey, I take it you're
just visiting someone.

223
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:42,309
Well, if you have some time
and you wanna visit someone else..

224
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,144
Yeah, I would like that.

225
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:50,150
-Great. I'm in room..
-Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!

226
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:53,987
You gotta press the button.

227
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,785
The nurse said
they're bringing in another woman.

228
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,162
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?

229
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:06,958
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.

230
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:11,713
-Oh, Ross! Another contraction.
-Oh, okay. Here, here.

231
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,674
That's it.

232
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:19,346
-Oh, that sounded like a bad one.
-Yeah, it was.

233
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:24,309
Mine haven't been so bad.
Oh, here comes one now.

234
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:31,566
Oh, that was a big one.

235
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:36,196
That was, like, the biggest one yet.
Are you okay, honey?

236
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,614
I'm okay, honey.

237
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:46,164
Well, I got some bad news.
It gets worse.

238
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:50,377
And when you get to the end,
they get really big..

239
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:53,088
and they come, like, every minute.

240
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,883
Well, mine are pretty close together.
I think..

241
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,852
-Excuse me.
-Yeah, that's quite all right.

242
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,313
Oh, by the way, my name's Johanna.
What's yours?

243
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,449
Excuse me, could you help me
with something?

244
00:17:20,615 --> 00:17:22,159
I'm looking for a man.

245
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,493
Well, who isn't?

246
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:27,664
You. You aren't.

247
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,541
Good for you.

248
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:33,587
Anyway, the patient
I'm looking for has a broken leg.

249
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:38,133
He's in a wheelchair. He's early
to mid-30s, very attractive.

250
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,509
Even you would think so.

251
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:44,806
-I know who you're talking about.
-Great! What room number is he in?

252
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,601
I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidential.

253
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,562
No, I'm not gonna bother him.
We were talking earlier..

254
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,483
Ma'am, I'm sorry. That information
is restricted to hospital staff.

255
00:17:54,649 --> 00:18:00,322
-She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
-Dr. Drake who?

256
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,161
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.

257
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,457
-A doctor at this hospital?
-Damn it, we're losing precious time.

258
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,626
You want this man's blood
on your head..?

259
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,836
-Hands.
-Hands!

260
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:19,841
It is absolutely essential that you tell me
what room he is staying in.

261
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,344
He's a patient of mine.
I've treated him for years.

262
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:25,055
-He's in room 816.
-816. Thank you.

263
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,016
-And what is his name?
-No.

264
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:44,366
-I think we found a place.
-Okay.

265
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,371
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?

266
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,999
Hello, Monica.

267
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,128
-Not like that.
-Oh, okay.

268
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,798
-We'll dim the lights.
-Okay.

269
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,009
Or turn them out altogether.

270
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:08,181
No scented candles.
Okay, here. There we go.

271
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,143
Okay, okay.
Making me sterile, but okay.

272
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:21,152
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.
Do we have a condom?

273
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,572
Oh, right!

274
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,416
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.

275
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,337
This is it!

276
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:43,091
-That's him!
-Great. Go get him!

277
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:47,762
Wait a second.
Or maybe you could go in first.

278
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:50,473
He's not really my type.

279
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,895
Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him
questions and see what he's like.

280
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:58,732
-People tell doctors everything.
-You said he was this great guy.

281
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,361
All the guys I meet seem nice at first,
then turn out to be big jerks.

282
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,823
-You do attract some stinkers.
-Yeah, I know.

283
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:11,328
Dr. Long, I've been at this
for 17 hours.

284
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:14,080
Three women have come
and gone with their babies.

285
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:19,002
You gotta give me good news. How many
centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?

286
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,338
-Three.
-Just three?

287
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,923
I'm dilated three!

288
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:30,388
We are moving along just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.

289
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:33,934
-I'll be back soon.
-Thank you.

290
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:38,939
You know what? I'm not waiting.
I'm gonna push this baby out.

291
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:44,027
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?

292
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,283
-Actually, it's more like this.
-Oh, stupid metric system.

293
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:56,790
We're gonna need to take you straight
to the delivery room.

294
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:59,918
Oh, for the love of God!

295
00:21:00,168 --> 00:21:01,836
It's coming! It's coming!

296
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,214
And here it is!

297
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,675
Oh, come on!

298
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:16,101
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few
routine questions I need to ask you.

299
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,561
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.

300
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,856
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side..

301
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:27,112
Dr. Wells wanted a more
comprehensive overview. So he sent me.

302
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,948
Dr. Wells is a woman!

303
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:34,160
That was a test. Good response.

304
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:38,998
-All right. Full name?
-Clifford Burnett.

305
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,502
-Date of birth?
-November 16, 1968.

306
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,170
Age?

307
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:51,177
-Can't you figure that out?
-I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.

308
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,056
-I'm 33.
-Okay.

309
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,351
-And are you married?
-No.

310
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:05,025
Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would
you say you have commitment issues?

311
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:09,612
Are all the questions this personal?

312
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,322
Yes.

313
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,744
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.

314
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,372
-Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.
-Yeah.

315
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:23,376
I lost my wife five years ago
to a mild cardial infarction.

316
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,301
-A heart attack, doctor.
-Oh, yeah. Well, yeah, mild car..

317
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,765
Are you experiencing any dizziness?

318
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:38,016
No.

319
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,518
-Has the pain been getting worse?
-No.

320
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:44,898
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

321
00:22:46,274 --> 00:22:48,151
-No.
-Excellent. Excellent.

322
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:53,990
And finally, are you into any weird
stuff, you know, sexually?

323
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:57,202
-No!
-Wrong answer.

324
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:05,085
-This room's available.
-Okay! Wait, you listen to me!

325
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,670
Since I have been waiting,
four women..

326
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:11,549
that's four, one higher than
the number of centimeters I'm dilated..

327
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:17,055
have come and gone with their babies.
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.

328
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:22,519
If you bring in one more woman who has
her baby before me, I will sue you.

329
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:27,023
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.
My husband is a lawyer.

330
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,027
-Rach?
-You get back on that case, honey!

331
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,280
I don't think the next
patient is very far along.

332
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:38,076
Okay. Well, then bring her in.

333
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:51,673
Oh, my God!

334
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:07,147
I can't believe this!

335
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,236
And yet, somehow, it's true.

336
00:24:13,862 --> 00:24:18,283
I mean, this is so great.
We're gonna be baby buddies!

337
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:23,997
Squeeze your legs together
and cover the baby's ears.

338
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:27,625
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hi, sweetheart.

339
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:31,629
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think
you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.

340
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,465
I nabbed him a year ago
at the dermatologist's office.

341
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:37,510
Thank God for adult acne!

342
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:41,639
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

343
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,641
Really?

344
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:45,727
What'd he say?

345
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:49,772
You have to speak very loudly,
he's almost completely deaf.

346
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:53,401
-Oh, there you go.
-Of course he is.

347
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:57,572
Congratulations, you two.
I didn't even know you got married.

348
00:24:57,822 --> 00:25:00,992
-Oh, we didn't.
-What?

349
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:06,664
We're just having this baby together,
but that's all, you know.

350
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,625
Why?

351
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:17,133
We're just not in that place, you know?
But we're very excited about this.

352
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:20,178
Oh. Well, then shut me up.

353
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:23,556
Just tell me how.

354
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:27,310
Oh, I feel another one coming.

355
00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:35,109
Sid, you lucky, deaf bastard.

356
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,241
-What else? What else?
-He's 33.

357
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,077
A widower.

358
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:49,749
He seemed like a standup guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.

359
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:53,586
Enter Phoebe!

360
00:26:01,552 --> 00:26:06,057
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty
private room right next door to hers?

361
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:10,395
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

362
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,608
Well, let me think about that
while I remove my pants!

363
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:21,030
Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

364
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:34,002
Does that sound like Janice?

365
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:37,130
If it's not, then there's two of them.

366
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:41,050
And that would mean
it's the end of the world!

367
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:43,761
Hey.

368
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:44,971
-Hey.
-Hi.

369
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:48,307
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How you doing?

370
00:26:48,516 --> 00:26:54,605
Not bad. You know that feeling, trying
to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

371
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,945
And soon someone will call her "Mom."

372
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:06,701
Weirdest thing. Did I hear..?

373
00:27:06,868 --> 00:27:09,370
Mother of God, it's true!

374
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:14,292
Chandler Bing!

375
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:15,460
Janice.

376
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,382
Not just Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

377
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:25,136
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

378
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,805
You remember, Chandler.

379
00:27:32,393 --> 00:27:34,354
I feel so bad for you.

380
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,982
She's your ex. And I have Richard.

381
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:42,362
Janice, I didn't even know
you were pregnant.

382
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:47,366
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

383
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:50,411
It's you.

384
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:52,914
This is yours.

385
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:54,749
What?

386
00:27:54,916 --> 00:28:00,046
Look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

387
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:06,094
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

388
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:11,641
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you eat?

389
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:16,270
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

390
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,943
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

391
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,906
Because at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

392
00:28:27,448 --> 00:28:31,077
-Oh. Somebody went to college.
-Yeah.

393
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,247
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

394
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:37,416
I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

395
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,420
Oh. I'll get it.

396
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:45,591
I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

397
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:50,138
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

398
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,270
When. When.

399
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:00,690
Thank you. Listen.

400
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:04,527
You seem to really know
what to do with a utensil.

401
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:06,779
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

402
00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:11,409
-Yeah, I'd really like that.
-Yeah?

403
00:29:11,576 --> 00:29:14,537
Yeah. And I promise I won't make
you eat any remarkable animals.

404
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,792
I was thinking..

405
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:23,004
I'd kind of like to make a move.

406
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:24,797
But, you know, with the leg.

407
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:26,883
Oh, yeah.

408
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,134
Maybe a little help.

409
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:30,511
Okay.

410
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,724
Let me fix your pillow.

411
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,227
Cliff, you're so forward.

412
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,526
Oh, it was really nice meeting you.

413
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:46,944
Sid!

414
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,656
That's the first time I heard her voice.

415
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,658
I didn't care for it.

416
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:02,752
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies..

417
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:05,379
and I have had no babies.

418
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:08,382
Why doesn't she want to come out?

419
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,970
You know what I think it is?
I think you made such a nice home for her..

420
00:30:13,137 --> 00:30:16,140
over the last nine months
that she just doesn't want to leave.

421
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:22,313
Oh, look at you making up crap for me.

422
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:26,567
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Okay.

423
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:29,362
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

424
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,864
Doctor, you gotta do something!
Get me drugs..

425
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:36,077
or light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out!

426
00:30:37,745 --> 00:30:41,207
Actually, I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

427
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,416
What?

428
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:47,004
Ten centimeters.
You're about to become a mom.

429
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:50,716
Oh, my God. Okay.

430
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:55,263
Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.

431
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,228
Is this the same spoon
that was in my cast?

432
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:06,148
You know what?

433
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:07,650
This one is.

434
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:17,451
Oh, my God! That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

435
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:23,249
Well, it must be one of those
closed-circuit hospital channels.

436
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,960
No, no. That's a soap opera.

437
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,795
This is a very dramatic hospital.

438
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:33,593
I'm telling you,
the guy from that show was here..

439
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:36,429
asking me all these weird questions.

440
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,764
Okay, Mr. Percocet.

441
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,102
I swear to you, that's the guy.

442
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:44,604
Okay, Cliff.

443
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,941
Do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?

444
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:52,903
What probably happened was you were
watching this, you drifted off to sleep..

445
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,488
and you dreamt he was here.

446
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,532
Rachel's having her baby!

447
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,581
Which is of no interest
to me as a neurologist. I..

448
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:06,792
That's him! You know him?

449
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,545
Wake up, Cliff!

450
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,758
What is going on?

451
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:18,304
Okay. Okay. I.. Okay.

452
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:22,516
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

453
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:26,646
If it.. You know, if it helps,
you came off great.

454
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:30,524
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

455
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:34,820
I don't believe this. You got him
to pretend he was a fake doctor?

456
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:38,616
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

457
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:46,165
-You tried making me think I was crazy?
-That was wrong. I'm so sorry.

458
00:32:46,374 --> 00:32:50,670
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

459
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,004
I don't think so.

460
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:57,176
If I may? You told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

461
00:32:57,385 --> 00:33:02,390
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

462
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:06,018
She was married to a gay ice dancer.

463
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:10,606
She gave birth to her
brother's triplets.

464
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:17,780
Her twin sister used to do porn.

465
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:22,076
-We're trying to dial down the crazy.
-Right.

466
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:28,791
We don't really know each other,
so it'd be easy to forget about this..

467
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:33,129
but there's something between us.
I don't know about you..

468
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,006
but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

469
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:41,554
-It doesn't happen to me either.
-Me neither!

470
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,306
-The baby! Rachel!
-Right, right!

471
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:46,434
Oh, I love this scene.

472
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:53,274
Okay, look. I gotta go too.

473
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,235
But.. What do you say?
Can we just have that dinner?

474
00:33:58,154 --> 00:34:00,364
The triplets.

475
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:01,991
You and your brother didn't..?

476
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:04,243
No! No, they implanted embryos.

477
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:06,871
-Then dinner sounds great.
-Great! Okay.

478
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,622
All right, then I'll see you later.

479
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,332
Our friend's having a baby.

480
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,251
-Her own?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

481
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,378
No, she's really old-fashioned.

482
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:21,218
Push. Push. We're gonna push
for five more seconds.

483
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,137
Five, four..

484
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,639
Three, two, one! Oh!

485
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:29,685
The next contraction should be
in about 20 seconds.

486
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:32,772
-I can't push anymore!
-You're doing great.

487
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,150
Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

488
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:38,694
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

489
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,738
-Come on.
-Push. Wait.

490
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:44,575
-I see something.
-What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

491
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,912
-Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!
-What is that?

492
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:50,581
The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

493
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,960
-I thought she had two heads.
-Oh, God!

494
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:56,420
Is she gonna be okay?

495
00:34:56,587 --> 00:34:58,047
-She's gonna be fine.
-Okay.

496
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:01,425
She's in a more difficult position,
so you have to push harder now.

497
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:03,969
-Okay.
-That's it. Push. Push.

498
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:06,055
You're gonna have to push even harder.

499
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:10,809
-I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!
-Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

500
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,314
I had no idea.
Please, you do it for me!

501
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:21,946
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

502
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,490
Good.

503
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,326
Keep pushing!

504
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:31,080
Are you okay?

505
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:35,834
You have no idea how much this hurts.

506
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:41,173
Keep going! Keep going!

507
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,675
Here we go!

508
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,928
She's upside down, but she's coming!

509
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,764
-Oh, God!
-Oh! Oh, my God!

510
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,892
Oh, my God, she's here.

511
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:56,981
Oh, she's perfect.

512
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:02,152
Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.

513
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:10,494
-Where'd she go?
-They're just wrapping her up.

514
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:14,874
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

515
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,795
Here she is.

516
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,225
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

517
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:38,272
I know. Oh.

518
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:48,073
She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

519
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,827
-Do we have a name yet?
-No, not yet.

520
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:55,581
That's fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Greene.

521
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,418
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.

522
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:19,355
Hello, Baby Girl.

523
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,906
-Can we come in?
-Oh, come on in.

524
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:35,079
-Oh, there she is.
-Oh, she's so beautiful.

525
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:36,747
Here.

526
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:42,086
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

527
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:47,257
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

528
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:51,970
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you..

529
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:55,391
and then 47 hours later,
here she is.

530
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:03,732
She looks so real.

531
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:06,110
You know what I mean.

532
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:08,779
She's this whole tiny little person.

533
00:38:08,946 --> 00:38:12,741
And she already has eyelashes
and knees and..

534
00:38:14,702 --> 00:38:16,286
-What?
-Oh, no, no. It's okay.

535
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:20,332
For a second, I counted six fingers, but one
was from the other hand. So we're good.

536
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,295
-Okay, my turn. My turn.
-Aunt Phoebe.

537
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:29,800
Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!

538
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:34,054
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

539
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:37,850
I won't.

540
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,605
-Honey, what's the matter?
-Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

541
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:47,651
The doctor said it's normal, with all
the hormones, plus you're sleep-deprived.

542
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,987
So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.

543
00:38:50,237 --> 00:38:55,242
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

544
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:57,369
Oh, God.

545
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:02,124
-What's the matter now?
-I was reliving it.

546
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,128
Do you know what you're gonna
call her yet?

547
00:39:06,295 --> 00:39:11,592
Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?
I thought that was so original.

548
00:39:12,468 --> 00:39:15,262
Actually, we've narrowed it
down to two names.

549
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:21,435
And you know what? I love them both.
So just pick one, and that'll be it.

550
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:27,316
Wow, okay. Everyone..

551
00:39:27,483 --> 00:39:31,570
this is Isabella.

552
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:35,657
-Hi, Isabella!
-Hi.

553
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:39,536
What?

554
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:42,456
That's not her name.

555
00:39:42,623 --> 00:39:46,126
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

556
00:39:46,502 --> 00:39:48,045
So then I guess Ferdinand is out.

557
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,967
-What was the other one?
-Delilah.

558
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:58,972
Oh, great! Suddenly she
sounds like a biblical whore.

559
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:05,604
So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

560
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,482
What are we gonna do?

561
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:11,401
-It's okay. You'll find a name.
-Easy for you to say.

562
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:14,404
You already know what your
kids' names will be.

563
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:18,992
-You do?
-I had them picked out since I was 14.

564
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:24,164
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

565
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:32,506
-Well, tell us, what are they?
-Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

566
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:36,093
-And if it's a girl?
-I don't wanna say.

567
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:40,347
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

568
00:40:40,514 --> 00:40:43,016
Okay. It's Emma.

569
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:46,270
Emma.

570
00:40:50,107 --> 00:40:53,068
See, I don't want it.

571
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:57,447
Do you have any other totally perfect
names that you're not gonna use?

572
00:41:01,743 --> 00:41:04,830
-Take it.
-What?

573
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:07,124
She's clearly an Emma.

574
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:10,627
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

575
00:41:10,794 --> 00:41:14,339
Yeah, but I love you more.

576
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:20,762
Besides, nothing goes with Bing.
So I'm screwed.

577
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:28,437
Hi, Emma.

578
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,982
Yep, that's you.

579
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:34,276
You're our little Em.

580
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:37,863
What's that, honey?

581
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,406
What?

582
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:42,201
Oh, you want a little cousin?

583
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:44,536
You want a cousin right now?

584
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,291
Do I look like a giant
sperm to all of you, or..?

585
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:07,100
-That was amazing.
-I know.

586
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:14,983
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

587
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,488
We may have started our family.
In nine months we could be here..

588
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:21,907
having our own baby.

589
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,453
And if not, we got to do it
on a bucket.

590
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:31,041
I love you so much.

591
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,502
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

592
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,299
You wanna do it again?

593
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:40,717
This time just for us?

594
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:45,931
Probably.

595
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:57,067
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

596
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:09,037
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

597
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:11,957
He's a keeper.

598
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,961
Look at the little munchkin.

599
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:19,006
Don't you worry. By the time
you're old enough to date him..

600
00:43:19,172 --> 00:43:21,300
he's gonna have a different nose.

601
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:27,014
-How you feeling?
-Oh, I'm fine.

602
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:33,812
I really admire what you're doing.
Just raising her all alone.

603
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:36,648
I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

604
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:42,279
Sure. Now. But what happens when he
meets somebody else and gets married?

605
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:46,783
Well, then he gets a divorce.
It's Ross.

606
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:51,872
I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.

607
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:58,211
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

608
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:03,842
-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
-That's what I thought.

609
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:07,262
I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
a weekend with her father..

610
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:09,848
and little Miss New Boobs.

611
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,809
Really?

612
00:44:13,226 --> 00:44:15,562
I hate to be the one to say it..

613
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:20,817
but, honey, you two are on your own.

614
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,863
Well, that's.. You know, that's..

615
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,326
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

616
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,204
Maybe we won't be alone.

617
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:37,334
Because lately things have been
happening between me and Ross.

618
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:42,255
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

619
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:48,387
So it might be the beginning
of something.

620
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:51,723
-Hey, Janice.
-Oh, hi.

621
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,353
Who's this little guy?

622
00:44:56,561 --> 00:45:00,899
-Aaron, your future son-in-law.
-Oh, no, no.

623
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,236
No.

624
00:45:04,611 --> 00:45:08,740
-I'm gonna leave you three alone.
-Okay.

625
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:12,494
Man, you see the kid on that nose?

626
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:18,667
You know what I was thinking about?

627
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:26,925
That kiss before we left the apartment.
That was something, huh?

628
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:31,054
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

629
00:45:31,221 --> 00:45:33,974
But we.. We gotta be careful.

630
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:38,562
We.. You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

631
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,107
Right.

632
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:48,697
-We don't want to go down that road.
-No. That's why I brought it up.

633
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,204
-They didn't have any sodas?
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

634
00:45:56,371 --> 00:46:00,459
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

635
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:05,088
And so it begins.

636
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:12,804
She in there?

637
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,475
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

638
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:20,228
Isn't it amazing how
every baby is beautiful?

639
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:22,439
Except that one.

640
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:26,318
What is this? A petting zoo?

641
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,116
Look. Look at Emma.

642
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:38,246
I can't decide who she looks like,
you or Rachel.

643
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:42,834
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

644
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:52,052
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

645
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:56,181
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

646
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:59,559
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

647
00:46:59,726 --> 00:47:03,438
It's complicated, okay?

648
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:05,273
Yeah, that's true.

649
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:08,735
You love her, you always have,
you have a child together.

650
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:11,196
There's no right answer.

651
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:17,702
Look, we've been together.
Then apart. Then together, then apart.

652
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:20,830
And now we have a baby.

653
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:27,963
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out..

654
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:31,716
I could never do that to Emma.

655
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:39,224
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything.. Now me.

656
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:43,144
What, do they put something
in the water here?

657
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:47,274
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

658
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,278
I know. If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

659
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:54,406
-Yeah, exactly.
-Right.

660
00:47:55,991 --> 00:48:00,245
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

661
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:10,922
Hey.

662
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,634
I saw a woman breast-feeding
twins at the same time.

663
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:17,595
It is like a freak show up here.

664
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,140
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

665
00:48:20,307 --> 00:48:21,975
What is it? Hey.

666
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:26,479
-Really, it's nothing. I'm..
-Rach, come on. What?

667
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:32,319
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

668
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,613
What are you talking about?
What about Ross?

669
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:41,995
Please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

670
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:45,332
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

671
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:48,627
I'm just saying that, you know..

672
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:51,963
someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody..

673
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,966
and he's gonna have his own life.

674
00:48:55,175 --> 00:48:56,468
Right?

675
00:48:57,344 --> 00:48:59,471
Yeah, I guess so.

676
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:06,853
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

677
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,813
That's pretty dumb, huh?

678
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:12,150
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

679
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:16,488
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

680
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:21,368
Okay? I promise
I won't let that happen.

681
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:28,249
Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

682
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:32,003
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

683
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:38,718
Could you grab me my other box
of tissues?

684
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:42,514
-They're under Ross' coat.
-Sure.

685
00:49:51,064 --> 00:49:54,025
Oh, my God!

686
00:49:54,484 --> 00:49:56,486
Joey?

687
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:01,116
Oh, my God.

688
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,540
Okay.
