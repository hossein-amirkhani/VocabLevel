1
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:08,626
Hey, I'm having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. Do you wanna come?

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,671
Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.

3
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:13,923
Oh, no, I'll be there too.

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:19,345
So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.

5
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:23,683
No, I just need you there for support.
I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,184
Oh. Why not?

7
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:28,563
Because I know he's gonna flip out,
and I hate it when he's angry.

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,524
Rachel, this is all
so "Papa Don't Preach."

9
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:35,194
No, Phoeb, wait. He's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

10
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:39,073
He said if he ever saw me doing that
again, he'd make me eat the entire pack.

11
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:41,784
Wow. Well, I will be there.

12
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:46,164
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man
make you eat your baby!

13
00:00:47,665 --> 00:00:51,169
Hey, who is that guy?
I think I know him.

14
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,212
No, you don't.

15
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:58,551
Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper
from your bachelorette party!

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,055
Her what?

17
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:07,393
Your secret bachelorette party.

18
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:12,482
-You had a bachelorette party?
-She untied his G-string with her teeth.

19
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:15,735
Somebody stop me!

20
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:21,574
We weren't having bachelor, bachelorette
parties. We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

21
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:24,535
It's a grand tradition!

22
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:28,289
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.

23
00:01:28,498 --> 00:01:31,459
Well, you could've untied it
with your hands.

24
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:36,214
This is so unfair. The one thing I wanted was
to throw my best friend a bachelor party..

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,509
but I wasn't allowed.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

26
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:42,762
You went home with the waitress.

27
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:46,224
Yeah, that was a pretty good night.

28
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,518
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

29
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:52,855
You know that the two pillars of
marriage are openness and honesty.

30
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:58,069
I knew giving you that book was gonna
come back and bite me in the ass.

31
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:42,196
-I'll order everyone the Moroccan chicken.
-Oh, I don't eat meat.

32
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:43,990
It's chicken!

33
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:49,245
-I don't eat that either.
-I never understand you lesbians.

34
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:56,294
-So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
-Well, actually..

35
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,504
Your '74 Lafite, sir.

36
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:03,134
I ordered the '75. That's a
magnificent wine. The '74 is sewage!

37
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:06,429
Why would you bring me sewage?

38
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:10,641
Is that a hard question? Are you an
idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,477
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you.

40
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,647
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

41
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:23,029
In case you didn't notice,
that is a scary man.

42
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,866
He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

43
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,246
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't.

44
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:33,497
Rachel..

45
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:39,253
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.

46
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:44,842
-Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
-Hey, that is the baby's problem.

47
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:52,850
-Everything okay with the waiter?
-I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.

48
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,732
So, sweetie, you were starting
to tell me what is new with you.

49
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,155
I got TiVo.

50
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:11,077
-What's TiVo?
-It's slang for "pregnant."

51
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:16,290
Well, what were you thinking
asking me to come?

52
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,004
Are you really pregnant?

53
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,424
Well, yes and no.

54
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:27,802
Except, not no.

55
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,304
So to sum it up, yeah.

56
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:34,725
Who is the father?
Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.

57
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,772
No, it's Ross. It's
Ross. You like Ross.

58
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,652
Daddy, I hope you're okay
with all of this.

59
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:48,406
Think about it. This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!

60
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,992
You're gonna be a poppy!

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,412
That's true. I'm a poppy!

62
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,207
I'm gonna be a poppy!

63
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,838
-So when is the wedding?
-The who?

64
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:08,384
The wedding.
There's going to be a wedding.

65
00:05:08,592 --> 00:05:14,181
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!

66
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:19,228
-Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!
-February 2nd!

67
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,695
It was cool seeing you lecture today.

68
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:32,533
Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
you were falling asleep.

69
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:38,205
No, I had my eyes closed so I could
concentrate and, you know, take it all in.

70
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,584
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.

71
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,671
-I've got to get going.
-Okay, I'll see you tonight?

72
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:53,304
Thanks for showing me your
semiprecious-stone collection. It's amazing.

73
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:58,059
My God, you must be good in bed.

74
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,605
So you and Mona, it's been a while now.
How's it going?

75
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,899
It's good. It's going good.

76
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:08,527
I mean, we get along great.
She's so..

77
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:11,989
-Hot?
-I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,034
She's okay with the baby?

79
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:19,455
I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off.

80
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:24,001
You have to be honest. Otherwise, you may
think you're going down the same path..

81
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,378
but you're really going
down different ones.

82
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,966
I'm gonna take that book and I'm
gonna beat you to death with it.

83
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,762
Oh, my God, you are gonna
love me so much.

84
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:38,808
Oh, good. Because so far in this
marriage, I just like you a lot.

85
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,894
All right. I felt bad about
the bachelorette party thing..

86
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,980
so tonight you're gonna have
a bachelor party.

87
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:50,110
I got this number from this guy at work and
I hired a stripper to come dance for you.

88
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:55,115
Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?

89
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:59,787
-Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
-Will you let the lady talk?

90
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:04,208
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.

91
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:07,878
I got you party hats and porn.

92
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,382
Throw in my father making out
with the magician..

93
00:07:11,549 --> 00:07:14,885
and it's just like my 14th birthday
all over again.

94
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:21,433
Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,188
Don't think of it as a bachelor party. Think
of it as a two-month anniversary present.

96
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:30,609
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.

97
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:36,031
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!

98
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,160
-Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.
-Yeah!

99
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:43,455
And Joey.

100
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:49,128
-Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
-Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

101
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,756
Actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona tonight.

102
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:56,677
Who would cancel an actual date
just to go to a fake bachelor party?

103
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,264
I'm sorry.
I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

104
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:09,982
I'm sorry I won't make it to your
imaginary wedding, but I'm busy that day.

105
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:15,738
I already have a unicorn baptism
and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

106
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,201
I know, I know. I panicked.

107
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:25,289
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.

108
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,291
It's Lafite.

109
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,128
The '74 Latour is actually
drinking quite nicely.

110
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:36,425
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna be strong.

111
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,844
I just called a friend of mine.

112
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:43,766
I think I may be able
to book The Plaza on short notice.

113
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,477
Really?

114
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,395
The Plaza?

115
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,814
Oh, Daddy!

116
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,903
-Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you.
-What is it, sweetie?

117
00:08:57,613 --> 00:09:00,491
There's not gonna be a wedding.
Ross and I aren't getting married.

118
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,118
-I'm sorry, Daddy.
-I don't believe this!

119
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:07,122
-Daddy, stay calm, please.
-How do you expect me to stay calm?

120
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:11,043
This is unacceptable, Rachel.
And I wanna know why!

121
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,213
Is it because that punk
won't marry you?

122
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:17,216
-Is that it?
-Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

123
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,603
You nervous about getting married?

124
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,024
What are you doing?

125
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,779
Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party,
before your wedding. It'll be more fun.

126
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,284
All right. I can't believe
tomorrow's the big day.

127
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:48,247
How's it feel knowing you're never
gonna be with another woman?

128
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:52,876
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up
to the same face every day..

129
00:09:53,043 --> 00:09:57,006
until you finally have
the sweet release of death.

130
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:01,593
You're right. This is more fun.

131
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:05,055
That's her! Okay, come on!

132
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,775
Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?

133
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,861
That's me!

134
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:21,280
That's me.

135
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,826
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

136
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:30,039
-Is that a bedroom?
-Yeah, right over there.

137
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,207
All right. Whenever you're ready.

138
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,919
That was weird.

139
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,882
-Why would she go in the bedroom?
-I'm waiting.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,187
-So she's a..
-Yeah, that's one naked hooker.

141
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:59,360
I love your place.
Where is this guy from?

142
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,946
That's an 18th-century Indian artifact
from Calcutta.

143
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,490
Oh. Wow.

144
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:09,161
So you're more than just dinosaurs.

145
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:11,663
So much more.

146
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,464
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

147
00:11:20,672 --> 00:11:22,883
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

148
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,722
Sorry.

149
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:36,146
You think you can knock up my daughter
and then not marry her?

150
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,816
I'm gonna kill you!

151
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:44,863
You know, this is actually not
a great time for me.

152
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:51,370
So come on.
Explain yourself, Geller.

153
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,581
-First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
-You got Rachel pregnant?

154
00:11:54,832 --> 00:11:56,583
-Who did?
-You did!

155
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:02,214
Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing.
It meant nothing.

156
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:06,176
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?

157
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:10,180
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
I care.. I love Rachel.

158
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:12,975
-What?
-But not that way.

159
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,186
I'm not in love with her.
I love her like a friend.

160
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:19,898
That's how you treat a friend,
get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?

161
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:24,486
Hey, I offered to marry her.
But I didn't want to.

162
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:29,074
Well, why not? So you could
spend your time with this tramp?

163
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,576
Tramp?

164
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,329
I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.
Mona, Dr. Green.

165
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:39,626
I can't believe there is
a naked hooker in there!

166
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,546
Maybe she's a hooker
and a stripper..

167
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:45,716
but she got confused
about what to do.

168
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:49,928
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.

169
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,392
Ma'am?

170
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,729
Are you also a stripper?

171
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,107
No, but I can pretend to strip.
But that's gonna cost extra.

172
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay, here's the extras:
handcuffs, spanking..

173
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,657
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

174
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:14,578
Getting her own husband a hooker.
That's pretty funny.

175
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:19,416
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

176
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:24,463
I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.

177
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:28,717
-Do you mind if I smoke in here?
-Actually, I'd rather..

178
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:33,096
Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to
burn that room down anyway.

179
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,810
-How could you have kept all this from me?
-I was going to tell you, but..

180
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:42,731
You figure you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.

181
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:47,319
Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

182
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:52,324
Can I..?

183
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:56,703
Why don't we just let the machine get that.

184
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,707
Hey, Ross, it's Joey.
There's a hooker over here..

185
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,002
and we thought maybe you'd
know something about it.

186
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,088
No! No! No!

187
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:07,506
No!

188
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,008
I need to lie down.

189
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,140
Hey, guys, can I talk to you
for a minute?

190
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:20,435
Listen, again, I want to urge you
to push the duck special..

191
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:23,939
because if they don't eat the duck,
you're going to, and it's not very good.

192
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:28,819
Tonight's the night
of the big bachelor party?

193
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:32,864
-Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
-No problem. Say, who's the party for?

194
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:36,451
-For my husband.
-You hired your husband a hooker?

195
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,454
-She's a stripper.
-No, she's a hooker.

196
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,875
-Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
-When they're hookers.

197
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:47,296
Oh, my God.
Stu, I can't believe you did this.

198
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:49,464
Now, you're sure she's a hooker?

199
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:54,553
It's either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.

200
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,017
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

201
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,061
Why would she do that?

202
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,189
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.

203
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:12,321
Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,616
This is the worst
bachelor party ever.

205
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,704
-What's taking you boys so long?
-In a minute!

206
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,665
"In a minute"?
What's gonna happen in a minute?

207
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,543
All right. Maybe you should ask her
to leave.

208
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,795
-Why me?
-Hey, it's your bachelor party.

209
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:33,759
-Which is why you should do it.
-I don't want to. You do it.

210
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:38,138
All right. Rock, paper, scissors
for who has to tell the whore to leave.

211
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,478
-What?
-I miss this.

212
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:48,065
I don't think we've
actually done this before.

213
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:50,817
No, I miss hanging out with you.

214
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:54,154
-We still hang out.
-Not like we used to.

215
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,449
Remember? You and me,
we used to be inseparable.

216
00:15:57,658 --> 00:16:02,371
You know, now it's like
things are different.

217
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,792
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

218
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:10,295
And, hey, don't get me wrong,
I am so happy for you guys.

219
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:15,717
I just miss hanging out.
Just us, you know?

220
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah, I miss that too.

221
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,224
I'll tell you what. From now on,
we'll make time to hang out.

222
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:25,310
You got it. Come here.

223
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,606
Oh, God.

224
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:32,984
Listen, I am this close
to robbing you guys.

225
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,697
She's a hooker! She's a hooker!
She's a..

226
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,410
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

227
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,710
So your dad dropped by.

228
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,337
He's a pleasant man.

229
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,924
-Oh, no.
-I better go.

230
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,933
Just over here.
I don't wanna miss the fight.

231
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:07,477
Ross, I am so sorry.

232
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,231
I promise, I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow, in person.

233
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,066
Or via e-mail.

234
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:18,947
I don't care about your dad. I care about
Mona. She was there and she's freaked out!

235
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,659
Okay, I'll fix that too.
What's her e-mail address?

236
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:26,746
All right, I promise, I'll fix this.
I swear. I'll talk to her.

237
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,707
Okay. Thank you.

238
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,128
That's it?
You call that a fight?

239
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:38,175
"We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
What happened to you two?

240
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:47,476
Thank you so much
for coming back over.

241
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:50,437
Oh, good. You're here.

242
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:54,316
And I was worried that
it was going to be uncomfortable.

243
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:56,610
No, Mona, just hear me out.

244
00:17:56,902 --> 00:18:00,780
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.

245
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,576
But I heard that you held your own.
You have to tell me how you did that.

246
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,078
-Focus.
-Okay.

247
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,415
Yes, Ross and I used to date.

248
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,960
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

249
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:18,173
But we are definitely not
getting back together.

250
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,968
-How can I be sure of that?
-Because we drove each other crazy.

251
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:28,225
He was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.

252
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,560
Trying to date this woman.

253
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,315
None of that compared
to how kind and gentle..

254
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,734
and thoughtful he is.

255
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,904
You probably shouldn't touch me.

256
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,908
I don't wanna get in the middle
of something so complicated.

257
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:48,495
I get it, but, Mona, what relationship
is not complicated?

258
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:51,581
We all have our baggage.
You must too.

259
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:54,960
Why else would you still be single?

260
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,671
I'm so gonna leave right now.

261
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,801
Should I leave this open?

262
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,430
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you
just tell me about all this?

263
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:10,809
Because what's going on has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

264
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:15,605
-You still should have told me.
-I know, and I was going to..

265
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:19,818
but I thought it was better
that you heard it from Rachel's father.

266
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,280
I made a mistake..

267
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:28,034
but it's only because
I really, really like you. Really.

268
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:33,748
Okay. I guess you can
close the door now.

269
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:49,306
Forgot my purse.
Oh, you guys made up.

270
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:54,144
He's a good kisser, isn't he?
I'm going!

271
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:03,361
I swear I didn't know
she was a hooker.

272
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,072
Did you let her smoke in here?

273
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:12,287
Her ass-print is still on your grandmother's
quilt. Really want to talk about smoking?

274
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,082
You know what,
I'm gonna make this up to you.

275
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,001
I promised you a stripper..

276
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,464
and you're gonna get a stripper.

277
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,885
-Monica, wait.
-What?

278
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:29,804
Carry on.

279
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,574
These tennis shoes are so tight.

280
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,663
-I think I'll take them off.
-Could you not narrate?

281
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,416
Gotcha, sailor.

282
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,386
Just because
you're not in love with the guy..

283
00:21:12,263 --> 00:21:15,600
-You told your dad the truth.
-About an hour ago.

284
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,270
-Wanna go see a movie?
-Yes.

285
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:23,900
Bye, Dad.

286
00:21:28,613 --> 00:21:32,242
It's unacceptable! What the hell does love
have to do with it?

287
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,328
There are more important things
than love.

288
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,582
You have to think about the baby.

289
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:44,045
You have to think about
the consequences of your decisions!

290
00:21:46,131 --> 00:21:50,802
Hey, I do think about
the consequences of my decisions!

291
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,180
Well, what gives you the right to..?

292
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,641
Go to hell!

293
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:02,814
Stupid guy on my phone.
