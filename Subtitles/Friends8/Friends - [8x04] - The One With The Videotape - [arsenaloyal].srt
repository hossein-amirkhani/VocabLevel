1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:10,211
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

2
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:13,214
I had a great time on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:17,009
I can't wait
to spend our life together.

4
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,430
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:23,349
You're back!

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,687
Come on in!

7
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,358
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:36,946
So much fun. The best part is,
we met this great couple.

9
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:41,701
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:45,163
They're cool.
It was their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,415
They live here in the city.

12
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:50,835
Can we go call them?
Is it too soon to call?

13
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:55,173
We're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,633
Oh, were you looking for that?

15
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,261
Well, yeah.

16
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:05,349
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

17
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,978
It's different.
Greg and Jenny are married.

18
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:12,815
Greg and Jenny?
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."

19
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:17,195
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

20
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:21,240
-They're great. If you just..
-You know what?

21
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:24,869
Give us our souvenirs
and get out of here.

22
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:29,707
-We didn't get a chance to..
-You're kidding!

23
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:34,086
-We didn't get anything for anyone.
-Nice necklace.

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,299
That you can have.

25
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:21,175
-Welcome home.
-How was the honeymoon?

26
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:24,428
Great! How about you?
You're having a baby!

27
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:26,764
Yeah, we are. It's so exciting.

28
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:30,643
I always knew you two
would have a child out of wedlock.

29
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:36,649
-Look, I have a sonogram picture.
-Good.

30
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:41,362
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

31
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:48,536
Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?
When? How many times?

32
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:52,623
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.

33
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,838
It happened about six weeks ago.

34
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:04,343
I got home and Ross was there.
He'd been hanging out with Joey.

35
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,346
You're welcome, buddy.

36
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,561
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,190
I had a lot of work,
and Ross offered to help.

38
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,068
We had wine, we got to talking.

39
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:25,239
Next thing you know,
Ross comes on to me.

40
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,201
That's a little misleading.

41
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:32,663
-What is?
-The lie you just told.

42
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,543
-That you came on to me?
-There's the one!

43
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:41,547
-But you did. Let's be honest.
-Yes, let's.

44
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:46,052
Ross. If it helps, I don't believe you.

45
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,056
It's not important.

46
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:55,227
What's important is, we're having
a baby, not who came on to who.

47
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,563
"Whom."

48
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,360
That's right.

49
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,198
-You kissed me first.
-You were begging for it!

50
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,867
You were sending me signals!

51
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:15,706
I was sending signals? Anyone think
that I'd send Ross begging signals?

52
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,417
Please, show of hands.

53
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:24,924
It doesn't matter what people believe!
It happened.

54
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:30,513
Maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals now?

55
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:35,309
-You know what? Just drop it.
-Show me how I begged you.

56
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:39,230
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

57
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,447
It's an expression.

58
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,542
Come on, Rachel, open up.
Let me explain.

59
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,044
-Still won't let you in, huh?
-No.

60
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,256
I'm just gonna close this door
so we can talk about you.

61
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:12,263
I can't believe
he taped them having sex.

62
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,559
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

63
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:19,812
Such a rookie mistake.

64
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:23,733
-Know who has a great camera?
-Greg and Jenny?

65
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:26,986
-I want to call them.
-Let's call.

66
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:30,489
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

67
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,497
Hello. 8th Street Deli?

68
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:42,752
Hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

69
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:46,088
-Sorry, wrong number.
-Here you go, babe.

70
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:51,635
Hello?
It's the deli again!

71
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:54,722
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

72
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,933
I don't think this number's right.

73
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:04,607
-What?
-You got fake-numbered.

74
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,820
-What? People don't do that.
-Oh, I think we do.

75
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,157
-Why would they do that?
-I don't know.

76
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:17,536
You were a delight.
You asked those great questions.

77
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:22,708
And you were never funnier.
Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!

78
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,503
You still got me and Phoebe.

79
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:29,673
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

80
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,804
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

81
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,014
I wonder why, pervert.

82
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:39,683
Okay, I am not a pervert.

83
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:43,187
That's, like, the pervert motto.

84
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:49,026
You raise your hand, put your left
hand down your pants and repeat that.

85
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,238
Filming Rachel was not planned.

86
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,699
Here's what happened.
Joey can back me up.

87
00:06:55,908 --> 00:07:00,913
A month and a half ago, remember
I came to you with a problem?

88
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,250
The personal thing?

89
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:09,505
-What personal thing?
-About sex?

90
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,468
That I hadn't had sex in months?

91
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,638
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

92
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:32,152
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

93
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,071
Sure.

94
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:38,993
How about you showering
with your mom?

95
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:44,498
I actually had a topic in mind.

96
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:52,381
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

97
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,384
-For, like, months?
-Five, to be..

98
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,595
lying. Six.

99
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:00,306
Six months? That's rough.

100
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:05,936
It's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the small things, like..

101
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:10,733
the sound of a bird
and the color of the sky.

102
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:14,737
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

103
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,533
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

104
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,995
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

105
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:28,042
I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,046
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it is putty.

107
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:33,839
Tell it to me.

108
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:38,969
Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

109
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,097
Remember, it is just the story.

110
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,977
I'll try to control myself.

111
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:53,484
Years ago, I was backpacking
across Western Europe..

112
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:59,114
-You were backpacking across Europe?
-Have a nice six more months.

113
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:04,787
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and..?

114
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:11,961
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

115
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,798
-Nice.
-Thanks.

116
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:21,220
I was at the end of this path,
and there was a lake.

117
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:25,474
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

118
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,353
It was dead silent.
Gorgeous.

119
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:35,484
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

120
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,654
But she was crying.

121
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:41,907
Why?

122
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,083
This is great wine.

123
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:53,585
It's from France.

124
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,589
In Europe.

125
00:09:57,881 --> 00:10:00,426
Western Europe.

126
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:08,308
A few years ago I was backpacking
across Western Europe.

127
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:12,271
-Really?
-Wait, it gets better.

128
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,942
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

129
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:21,030
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

130
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:26,118
-You did?
-Yeah. When were you there?

131
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:27,578
-Eighty..
-Nine?

132
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,079
Three.

133
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,583
I was 13?

134
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:39,214
-So anyway, I was hiking..
-I love hiking!

135
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,383
That's great!

136
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:47,765
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo..

137
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:52,144
-I think it's "Tibidabo."
-Do you want to tell the story?

138
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:58,025
How'd your date go?

139
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:02,237
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

140
00:11:02,905 --> 00:11:07,785
-Your story sucks.
-Then you didn't tell it right.

141
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:11,371
-Show me how you did it.
-No, I don't want to.

142
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,919
-How long since you seen a girl naked?
-I was backpacking..

143
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:22,383
-I'm not feeling it.
-I was outside Barcelona, hiking..

144
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:28,263
-Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
-It's been six months. I'm always hot.

145
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:32,518
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

146
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,729
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

147
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,357
Do what I do before an audition.

148
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:40,234
I'm not hungry.

149
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,028
No.

150
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:48,700
Use my camera to record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

151
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,494
I'll try that.

152
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:57,000
Now, you're all set up. Good to go.
Just hit record. Good luck.

153
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:03,632
If you ever have any problem with the
ladies, you know I'll help you out.

154
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,889
That means a lot to me, man.

155
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:34,955
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

156
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,085
Ross, thank God you're here.
You have to help me.

157
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:43,088
Were you talking to yourself?

158
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:47,050
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

159
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:51,263
When she came in,
I totally forgot about the camera.

160
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:55,100
It kept rolling
and recorded everything.

161
00:12:56,768 --> 00:13:00,022
Yeah, we're gonna need
to see that tape.

162
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:04,735
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

163
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,489
Come on, it'll be like watching
the Discovery Channel..

164
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,532
only we'll know the monkeys.

165
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:14,077
Look, I'm not gonna let you guys
watch us.

166
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:18,957
-I haven't even seen it yet.
-I'll trade you two tapes of me having sex.

167
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,002
Thanks, I'm good.

168
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,213
We don't wanna see the dirty stuff..

169
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:28,342
-just the stuff leading up to it.
-No. Rachel's gonna kill me as it is.

170
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:31,511
It's not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

171
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,931
Thank you.

172
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:39,811
-No.
-You're right.

173
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:45,317
-Joey, no.
-Loud and clear.

174
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,993
I don't get why
they'd give us a fake number.

175
00:13:55,452 --> 00:14:01,291
If they knew what they were doing,
they didn't give you real names.

176
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,672
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but not fake names.

177
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:10,842
Hi. Ken Adams.
Nice to meet you.

178
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,179
Regina Phalange.

179
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:17,683
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-I know.

180
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,146
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

181
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:27,818
You said they were funny.
Joke, joke, joke!

182
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:30,696
Joke, joke..

183
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:38,662
-It was your questions.
-What about them?

184
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,001
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

185
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:49,256
-Was that another joke?
-Was that another question?

186
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,427
Is Ross still here?

187
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,514
Watch out, honey.
Someone else is asking questions now.

188
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:05,439
No, but he told us what happened.
It was an honest mistake.

189
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:10,485
How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

190
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:12,946
Oh, forget it.

191
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:19,786
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

192
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,081
It was an accident, okay?

193
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:26,501
I feel bad.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

194
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:29,463
Anyway, here.

195
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:33,800
You might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

196
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,094
Thank you.

197
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:45,437
What?

198
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,484
-You don't want to see this, do you?
-Hell, yeah!

199
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:54,029
I am not gonna show you this.

200
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:58,241
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

201
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,535
Forget it.

202
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:06,625
We'll think of another way to put the
"who came on to who" thing to rest.

203
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,795
Come on now, think!

204
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:14,800
It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants.

205
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:19,513
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

206
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:23,558
-I want to see it.
-What?

207
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,977
You don't want us to see this.

208
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:32,526
You so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it.

209
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:37,656
Are we watching the tape or not?

210
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:43,995
-It's for your sake.
-I don't believe you.

211
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,833
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

212
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:53,046
-Rachel, please?
-Oh, a little preview.

213
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:59,970
Fine. I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

214
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,684
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying..

215
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,233
Okay, here we go.

216
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,989
I'm so happy.

217
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:25,328
Thank God you're here. Help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

218
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:29,541
-There I am.
-You're gonna get pregnant.

219
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,877
I screwed up so bad.

220
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:37,382
I told Monica that I'd send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

221
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,050
You didn't do it?

222
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:44,556
I put them in my desk at work,
and forgot about them until today.

223
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:52,731
Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it
to the wedding. I'm fine.

224
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:57,444
-Kind of hurting my hand though.
-I know.

225
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:03,074
I can't believe it, especially after
Monica went on and on about it.

226
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:07,704
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

227
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:12,709
Please, drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

228
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:25,806
Did you do it on our invitations?

229
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,436
Not on the ones we sent out.

230
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:37,067
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

231
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,911
It seems like yesterday
they just got engaged.

232
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,955
I know.

233
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:55,418
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost..

234
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:59,422
Oh, I remember how we almost.

235
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:02,843
You think we would've
gone through with it?

236
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:05,846
You think we would have done it?

237
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:12,185
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you did.

238
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:15,230
Oh, I wanted to.

239
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:20,235
So we both wanted to.

240
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,363
Interesting.

241
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:32,122
Anyway, it probably worked out
for the best.

242
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,499
Yeah, sure.

243
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,252
In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.

244
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:41,047
In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

245
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:50,849
Did I ever tell you about the time
I backpacked through Western Europe?

246
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,609
Get ready to see some begging.

247
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:05,155
-Oh, you came on to Ross!
-What?

248
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,949
Now I'm so happy.

249
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:12,287
-What?
-You used the Europe story!

250
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:17,167
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

251
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:23,465
-How do you know about that story?
-How do you know about that story?

252
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:27,052
My friend Irene heard it
from some guy.

253
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,971
Some guy!

254
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:37,187
No, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

255
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,814
Ken Adams!

256
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,329
So, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

257
00:20:54,704 --> 00:21:00,377
About that, the "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

258
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,588
It would have happened either way.

259
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:08,885
If you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

260
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:13,890
-It was an amazing night.
-It was. It was amazing.

261
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:19,562
You think it looked amazing?

262
00:21:20,522 --> 00:21:25,360
I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

263
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,278
Yeah, me neither.

264
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,739
Yet.

265
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:38,998
-That may be weird.
-Yeah, it would be really weird.

266
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:53,263
-Good luck.
-Good luck to you.

267
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:57,600
-Mind if I mute?
-Oh, please.

268
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:02,814
-There go the clothes.
-You are undressing awfully quickly.

269
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:06,234
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

270
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,830
-We look pretty good.
-I was gonna say.

271
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:22,083
-Nice tan.
-Thank you.

272
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,628
I'd just gone to
the beach that weekend.

273
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:33,178
-Have you been working out?
-I have been working out.

274
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:38,349
This is so much better
than I ever..

275
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,983
Oh, that's not pretty.

276
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,905
-Make it stop. Make it stop.
-Oh, no!

277
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,331
Greg and Jenny's number
is totally different in here.

278
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,044
-I don't ask too many questions, do I?
-No.

279
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:07,545
-Really?
-Absolutely not.

280
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:09,839
-Really?
-Oh, God.

281
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:16,471
I bet that phone thing was some sort
of mix-up. I'm gonna call them.

282
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,144
Hello, Greg?
This is Monica from the plane.

283
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:27,232
Listen, the number that
you gave me, 8-5-3..

284
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:30,860
Jenny's been giving out
their old number!

285
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:34,781
Jenny! That is so Jenny!

286
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:39,077
How would you like to
get together next Saturday?

287
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,412
Okay, how about Sunday?

288
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,123
Okay, the week after that?

289
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,084
The week after that?

290
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:52,549
You know what? We are interesting,
funny people with good questions.

291
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,553
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that..

292
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,429
January 15?

293
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,266
We'll see you then!
