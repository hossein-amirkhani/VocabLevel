1
00:00:03,162 --> 00:00:07,333
Phoebe. Will you check out that guy
by the window. Wow!

2
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:12,338
That guy back there? He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.

3
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:15,299
And to be completely honest,
he's not that good in bed.

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:18,344
Really?

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,890
What is wrong with me lately?
It's like, every guy I see.

6
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,059
I mean, look at that guy, for example.

7
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:28,229
That's not someone
I would be attracted to.

8
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,481
But right now,
with the way I'm feeling..

9
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:34,902
all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants
and fanny pack.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,240
Wait a second! This is about the fourth
month of your pregnancy, right?

11
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,409
-Yeah.
-This is completely normal.

12
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,995
Around the fourth month,
your hormones start going crazy.

13
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,457
-Really? So this has happened to you?
-Absolutely!

14
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,959
And keep in mind now,
I was carrying triplets.

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:54,589
So in medical terms,
I was thrice as randy.

16
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:57,425
Wow, this explains so much!

17
00:00:57,717 --> 00:01:02,513
Last weekend, I went from store to store,
sitting on Santas' laps.

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,726
Yeah, I remember trying
to steal a cardboard cutout..

19
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:09,937
of Evander Holyfield
from a Foot Locker.

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,525
Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow.
I'll ask her about this.

21
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:16,611
Maybe she can give me a pill
or something.

22
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:19,280
Yeah, that's what you need.
A good pill.

23
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:26,954
Oh, no. Short, crazy guy recognizes me.
Worst mistake of my life.

24
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:30,124
Call me.

25
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,626
I got our pictures developed
from Rockefeller Center.

26
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:17,171
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out
pictures of me and Mona ice-skating?

27
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:23,636
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.

28
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,644
Where are the pictures that that creepy
pretzel vendor took of us together?

29
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,355
Oh, yeah.
Probably at the end.

30
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,776
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures
of my breasts.

31
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,653
I'm missing picture time!

32
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,995
You know, she has a face, Ross.

33
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:54,333
I didn't take these, okay? I didn't even
know my camera had a zoom lens.

34
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,502
"Comma, officer."

35
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:01,507
-Okay, here's a good one of us.
-Wow, that is a good one!

36
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,509
It looks like a holiday card.

37
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:07,805
With the tree in the middle
and the skaters and the snow.

38
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,433
Good job, pretzel pervert.

39
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,894
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
holiday cards and I never do it.

40
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,606
Do you want
to send this one out together?

41
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,238
Together? Like, to people?

42
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:28,951
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona
and Ross." It'll be cute, okay?

43
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,037
Okay.

44
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:34,040
-I gotta get to work. Call me later?
-Sure, sure.

45
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:36,459
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

46
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,006
Congratulations! You just got married!

47
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:44,925
I know. Can you believe that?

48
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:48,012
I'm sorry. What's the big deal
about a holiday card?

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,682
Married couples send out cards.
Families send out cards.

50
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:55,311
People who have been dating for
a couple of months don't send out cards.

51
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:58,939
-What is she, crazy?
-That's your wife you're talking about!

52
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:04,028
No, really. I mean,
that would be like a huge step forward.

53
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:06,447
I like things just the way they are.

54
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,408
I'm finally in a relationship
that's not moving too fast.

55
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:13,412
You know, ordinarily,
I'd be divorced by now.

56
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:17,458
Okay, so just tell her you don't wanna
send out the card. What's she gonna do?

57
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,918
This.

58
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:22,963
Oh, okay. I didn't mean
to put pressure on you..

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,258
I just thought it would be something fun
for us to do together..

60
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,303
but okay, that's okay.

61
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:36,602
Okay, stop. Stop. You're right,
it's not that big a deal. I'll do the card.

62
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:43,442
-What? I said I'd do it.
-I know, it's just..

63
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,444
Can I have $20?

64
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:58,374
-Hi. You ready for lunch?
-One second.

65
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:06,382
-That's cute.
-Bing! And the Bingette!

66
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:09,260
I thought it felt a little hotter
in the office today.

67
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,681
-Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.
-Yes. Hi.

68
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:17,101
Good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.

69
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,645
I didn't know you and Kara divorced.
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,149
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out
of that bear trap.

71
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:28,988
-Congratulations to you guys, though.
-No leg-chewing for us, sir.

72
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,615
Well, give it time.

73
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:36,162
So the divorce, the marriage,
we got a lot to celebrate.

74
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,123
How about we all go out
to dinner tomorrow night.

75
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:42,001
I can't think
of anything we're doing.

76
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,087
Why can't I think
of anything we're doing?

77
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:47,840
Tomorrow night it is.
I should be out of court by 6.

78
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,426
They keep throwing sexual harassment
cases at me..

79
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:53,345
and I keep knocking them
out of the park!

80
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,681
Okay, see you tomorrow.

81
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,517
Just so you know,
we're not seeing him tomorrow.

82
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:02,146
Honey, once you get to know him,
he's much, much worse.

83
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:03,731
I can't do this alone.

84
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:08,360
Honey, I'm sorry. I can't help you. I can't
spend another evening with that man.

85
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,238
Do you remember how he behaved
at our wedding?

86
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,657
That's because he wasn't invited.

87
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:16,452
Because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.

88
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,873
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through
an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

89
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,890
Oh, what the hell? B plus.

90
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:47,399
Hi! I went by the photo shop.
Take a look.

91
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,110
Here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?

92
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,324
Wow, that's great.

93
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:59,036
Do you think it should say,
"Love, Ross and Mona"?

94
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:03,499
Well, we haven't said that
to each other yet..

95
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,545
but I guess it's okay
to say it to other people.

96
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:11,841
-How many did you want? I'll get 100.
-A hundred?

97
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:17,388
Well, I guess I'll take..

98
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,598
Mona?

99
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:25,771
I'm not sure
about the whole card thing.

100
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,439
Really? Why not?

101
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:32,152
Sending out a holiday card together?

102
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:37,116
I just don't know
if we're really quite there yet.

103
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:41,245
I didn't think of it that way.
You're right.

104
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,085
-So can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

105
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:50,087
Where are we?

106
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:56,051
You know, where are we?
Where is this relationship going?

107
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,896
I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.

108
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:10,441
We should talk about that,
don't you think?

109
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,242
Let's do the card!

110
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:25,623
-What?
-The card! I think we're there!

111
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,460
Okay. But I still think
we should have this conversation.

112
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,503
Really?

113
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:34,757
Even with the card?

114
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:45,267
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here
today, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

115
00:08:45,517 --> 00:08:48,854
Oh, okay.
Can I ask you a question?

116
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:53,651
Was it me, or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute?

117
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:58,447
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

118
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,118
Actually, never mind.
I just answered my own question.

119
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:08,582
-Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
-Yes, you are.

120
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,419
-Okay, now he's cute, right?
-Oh, God, yes.

121
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,047
So, how's it going?

122
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,884
It's going really good.
But enough about me! Come on.

123
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,428
Where are you from?
What do you do?

124
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,599
-I'm a doctor.
-Right. I meant..

125
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,769
in your spare time.
Do you cook? So you ski?

126
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:32,231
Or just hang out with your wife,
or girlfriend?

127
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,734
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend,
but I do like to ski.

128
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:40,197
I love to ski!
How amazing is this?

129
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:45,411
-Are you experiencing any discomfort?
-No, I'm very comfortable.

130
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,206
-Any painful gas?
-No!

131
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,753
Dr. Schiff!
What kind of question is that?

132
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,424
Okay, then. Would you like
to lie down on the table?

133
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,427
Would you like me
to lie down on the table?

134
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:06,056
-Is there something going on here?
-Do you feel it too?

135
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,273
-Hi.
-How did your doctor's appointment go?

136
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,610
Well, let's see,
they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

137
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,990
In the middle of the exam,
I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

138
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,493
-Oh, my God!
-Why did you do that?

139
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:30,664
Remember that little problem I was having
during my fourth month of pregnancy?

140
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,625
Oh, yeah!
The Evander Holyfield phase.

141
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:38,047
Oh, man! You were so hard up,
you practically came on to me.

142
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,507
You wish.

143
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,885
Hey, I could have had you
if I wanted you.

144
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,805
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

145
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:52,478
Okay, even this is turning me on.
You guys, I got problems.

146
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:58,442
Oh, hey. Hey, Ross!
How's it going with you and Mona?

147
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,903
Are you guys still together?

148
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,824
Yeah, we're moving forward.
You'll be getting our card.

149
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,786
You're doing a holiday card?

150
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,331
We're not just doing a card.
She also wants to have the conversation..

151
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,500
about where the relationship
is going.

152
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,710
Women!

153
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:21,090
I know! Why do you guys need
to have this conversation?

154
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:24,927
No self-respecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"

155
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:26,887
Ross, you asked me that.

156
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:32,017
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!

157
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,313
What are you gonna say to her?
Where is this relationship going?

158
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,859
I don't know. I really like her
and I wanna keep dating her.

159
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:43,278
-So tell her that.
-No, I can't.

160
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,532
Because then she's gonna say,
"Well, it's not moving anywhere..

161
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,785
-then we should just break up."
-Yeah, that's true.

162
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:56,708
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them. Really.

163
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,586
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture..

164
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:03,340
something that says we're moving
forward without having to talk about it.

165
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,051
Like asking her
to move in with you?

166
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:08,262
Smaller than that.

167
00:12:08,637 --> 00:12:12,015
-Making her a mix tape?
-Bigger than that.

168
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:17,271
-Give her a key to your apartment.
-We were closer with the mix tape.

169
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,940
Have you said, "I love you"?
You could say, "I love you."

170
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,152
I don't think I'm quite there yet.

171
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,905
But I could say,
"I love spending time with you."

172
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,741
-We hate that.
-That is a slap in the face.

173
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,830
Forget it. You know what?
I'll just have the conversation.

174
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:40,210
I'll just say I like things the way
they are, and hope for the best.

175
00:12:40,752 --> 00:12:42,546
What do you think, Rach?

176
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:46,049
I think if it was
a little colder in here..

177
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,886
I could see your nipples
through that sweater.

178
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:56,935
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

179
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,771
As it turns out, we can't do it.
Monica has to work.

180
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,566
My ex-wife didn't work.

181
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:06,278
Unless you call turning
into her mother "work."

182
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,948
Fine. Tomorrow night then.

183
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:13,911
-Tomorrow's no good for her, either.
-Why not?

184
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:17,164
It's the semifinals..

185
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:21,668
of her bocce ball tournament.

186
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,962
Okay. The night after that then.

187
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,799
Well, that's the finals, and I think
she's gonna go all the way, sir.

188
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:34,973
What's going on, Bing? Does your wife
have a problem with me or something?

189
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,809
Well, now you're just talking crazy.

190
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,812
Then why can't the three of us
go out together?

191
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:44,149
Because we split up.

192
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,485
Monica and I split up.

193
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:48,654
Hold me.

194
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:54,660
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say
I'm altogether surprised.

195
00:13:54,868 --> 00:14:00,040
I saw the way she looked at you,
and there was no love there.

196
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:05,045
And the way she looked at me,
pure lust.

197
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:09,800
What would really help me through
this tough time is choking someone.

198
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,136
I know how you feel. Oh, yeah.

199
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,514
I know what it's like to give a woman
all your love..

200
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:18,350
and then have that love
thrown back in your face.

201
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:23,939
And then the court decides to give you
custody of those fat, left-handed twins.

202
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,194
Well, they're lucky to have you, sir.

203
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,031
Bing, my boy,
we're gonna get you over this.

204
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,868
Here's the plan: Grab your coat,
we're going to a strip club!

205
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh, no!
Monica would freak.

206
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,625
But to hell with that bitch!

207
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:48,630
Here we go.

208
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:55,804
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.

209
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:59,683
Yeah, I think I suggested that.

210
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:02,561
We are so..

211
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:13,447
Well, I really like you.
And I love hanging out with you.

212
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:17,909
And I'm having a lot of fun.

213
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,082
Okay.

214
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:29,087
There's no point in spending time
with someone if it's just fun.

215
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:33,467
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

216
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:36,803
So where is it going?

217
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,854
That's the real question.

218
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,027
And the answer is..

219
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:55,781
it's going somewhere..

220
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:58,283
fun.

221
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:04,623
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

222
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,293
But you're not getting any younger.

223
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,213
No! I mean, not you.
Not you.

224
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,341
You are getting younger!

225
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:20,138
You're getting younger by the second.
What's your secret?

226
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,644
I'm sorry, so where are we?

227
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,313
Well, to sum up..

228
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:37,155
we're having fun.
You look young.

229
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,787
-Okay..
-But that's not enough.

230
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,959
So..

231
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:55,674
here's a key to my apartment.

232
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,885
-Really?
-Really.

233
00:17:00,554 --> 00:17:03,181
You don't think this is too fast?

234
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,687
You gave her a key
to your apartment?

235
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:13,608
Not just a key.
I gave her the only key!

236
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:19,614
I am now a homeless person
in a very serious relationship!

237
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:25,287
-Why did you give her a key?
-She talked me into a corner, okay?

238
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:29,040
She's like this conversational wizard.

239
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,211
So you had the conversation
you didn't wanna have..

240
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:36,256
and you made the gesture
you didn't wanna make.

241
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:40,719
Did I start this by saying, "Hey,
I did something awesome today"?

242
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,140
-Do either of you have a key to my place?
-I don't think you've ever given us keys.

243
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:47,058
Yeah, why would I? It's my home.

244
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:54,983
-Ross, how did the conversation go?
-Great. I live on the street.

245
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,277
Where?

246
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:01,281
-Hi.
-Okay, Monica, Rachel..

247
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,242
-this is my friend Roger.
-Hi, Roger.

248
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:08,413
I'll get us some drinks.
Could you help me?

249
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,041
Yeah, okay.

250
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,090
He's here to have sex with you.

251
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,222
-What?
-You're welcome.

252
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:29,935
-Phoebe, no!
-It's okay. He's a virgin.

253
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:39,444
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.

254
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,197
Let's leave these two alone.

255
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:47,994
No! I don't care what my hormones are
doing! I won't do it with some random guy!

256
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:52,374
Fine! Then you tell Roger, because
he was really looking forward to this!

257
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:13,645
Bing! Look at those twin sisters
dancing together.

258
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,816
Let me buy you a lap dance
with those girls.

259
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:22,320
That's all right, sir.
And that's just one girl.

260
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:26,616
-Bing, what's this?
-It's a hand.

261
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,119
It's a thing you use
as a Jack and Coke holder.

262
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:34,457
It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.
We'll throw it in the East River!

263
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,084
-No!
-Yes!

264
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:41,298
I did it, and I felt a lot better! You
might even hit a seagull in the head.

265
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:47,137
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch
of extra keys.

266
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,473
Apparently, I give them away
for no reason at all.

267
00:19:53,101 --> 00:19:56,479
Ross, what's going on?
You're changing the lock?

268
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:58,023
No.

269
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:00,150
That guy is.

270
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:04,654
You give me a key to your apartment,
and then you change the lock?

271
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,116
Good luck, buddy.

272
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:16,875
I thought we were moving forward. Now
you're sending me all these mixed signals.

273
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,960
What are you trying to tell me?

274
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:23,798
I'm trying to tell you..

275
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,385
I made you a mix tape.

276
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:31,389
-What?
-I love you.

277
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,065
And I love spending time with you.

278
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,700
-Hi, honey, I'm home.
-From the tequila factory?

279
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:53,036
It was awful.

280
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:56,539
To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.

281
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:59,709
So then he took me to these strip clubs
and sleazy bars.

282
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,714
When I wouldn't give him my wedding
ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.

283
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,094
Come here.
I can breathe through my mouth.

284
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:12,389
-Oh, sweetie.
-You know what the worst part was?

285
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,975
I got to see what my life
would be like without you.

286
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,604
It was like It's a Wonderful Life
with lap dances.

287
00:21:21,564 --> 00:21:24,484
Please promise me
that you'll never leave me..

288
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:29,447
that we'll grow old together, and be
with each other for the rest of our lives.

289
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,408
I promise.

290
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:37,163
Speaking of together, how about
we send out a holiday card this year?

291
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:40,083
I don't know if we're there yet.

292
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:47,173
I'd like to order a pizza.
Can I ask you a question?

293
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:52,929
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

294
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,682
-I'll call you back.
-Who was that?

295
00:21:55,932 --> 00:22:00,145
-It's just the pizza place.
-You hung up on the pizza place?

296
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:03,356
I don't hang up on your friends.

297
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,027
-Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
-What's wrong?

298
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:11,448
-You don't want to hear about it.
-Then why did I ask?

299
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:16,619
Okay, this is really embarrassing, but
lately, with this whole pregnancy thing..

300
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,331
I'm just finding myself..

301
00:22:20,623 --> 00:22:22,834
How do I put this?

302
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:25,837
Erotically charged.

303
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:30,717
Is that college talk for "horny"?

304
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:36,639
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do about them.

305
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:41,019
I can't date like a normal person, which is
fine because I don't need a relationship.

306
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:45,065
All I really want is one great night!
Just sex.

307
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:47,942
No strings attached.
No relationship.

308
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:52,697
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what he's doing.

309
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:58,578
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard..

310
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:02,207
to find?

311
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,047
So how was your day?

312
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:13,551
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

313
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:21,392
Well, I gotta get up early,
and it's almost 7:00.

314
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,020
-I gotta go to my room.
-Good night!

315
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,231
Good night!

316
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:31,569
-I can't do it!
-I didn't ask you to do it!

317
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,196
-You're Rachel!
-You're Joey!

318
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:35,073
-You're my friend!
-Right back at you.

319
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:39,577
Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong,
and weird and bad!

320
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,706
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking
about. I didn't ask you to do anything!

321
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,583
I know!

322
00:23:54,592 --> 00:23:56,010
-You wanna do it?
-No!

323
00:23:56,219 --> 00:24:00,056
-I'm just testing you!
-Well, that's the end of this conversation!

324
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,600
-This conversation never happened!
-Never happened!

325
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:05,061
-Good night!
-Good night!

326
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,777
Get back in there!

327
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:24,372
Listen, I'm sorry about
that whole thing with Roger.

328
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,417
It really wasn't right.
And I want to make it up to you.

329
00:24:27,584 --> 00:24:32,797
So I brought you something
I think you'll really enjoy.

330
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:45,810
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.

331
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,897
I'm gonna go now.

332
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:56,070
I'm sorry.
I thought I could do it, and I can't.
