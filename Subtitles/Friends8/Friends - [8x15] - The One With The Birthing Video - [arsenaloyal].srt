1
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:04,580
-Oh! Hey, Rach!
-Hi.

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:07,583
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,335
How's living at Ross'?

4
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:15,174
It's good, except he makes us watch
the Discovery Channel all day long.

5
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:20,847
Something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.

6
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:24,559
Oh, thank you.
I'll see you guys later.

7
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:31,607
That is one lucky
to-go cup of coffee.

8
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:37,363
I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.

9
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:42,285
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?

10
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,328
Thanks. Maybe later.

11
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,875
-Gunther, can I get a scone?
-Want anything?

12
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,252
I want a lot of things.

13
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:54,213
I wanna be with the woman I love
on Valentine's Day.

14
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,382
I want her to love me back.

15
00:00:56,632 --> 00:01:02,346
And I want relief from the wrenching
pain of knowing that won't happen!

16
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,057
We have red bagels.

17
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,228
Okay.

18
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,686
So how do you guys
like living together so far?

19
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,563
-Oh, it's been good.
-Yeah.

20
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,191
Except Ross is more uptight
about crumbs than you are.

21
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:57,944
There was a drumstick in the couch.

22
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:01,697
And I am not uptight about crumbs.

23
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,324
It's just that, you know..

24
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,452
crumbs attract mice.
And mice leave droppings.

25
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,538
And that's how the plague started.

26
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,332
So you wanna relive that again..

27
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,584
Mice didn't start the plague.

28
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,961
Rats did.

29
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,463
Rattus norvegicus, to be exact.

30
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,592
Oh, good God, Ross.

31
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,220
Nick at Nite, once in a while.

32
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,057
All right, I'm going.
Bye.

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,475
Phoebe, will you wait here?

34
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:31,727
-I wanna get your opinion on something.
-Yeah.

35
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:35,273
How does Mona feel about
Rachel moving in?

36
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,608
I'm on my way to tell her.

37
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:40,820
She's been away all week,
but she'll be cool.

38
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:42,738
She's been so supportive.

39
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:47,451
She even got the baby a T-shirt
that says "Fossils are my friends."

40
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,789
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.

41
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:53,958
So I'm gonna take off.

42
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,296
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
Rachel wanted to see this tape.

43
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,257
-What is it?
-My friend giving birth.

44
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:04,176
Could you take it to your apartment?

45
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:07,346
"Candy and Cookie"?

46
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,182
Candy's the mom,
Cookie's the daughter.

47
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,727
The father's name is also Cookie.

48
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,565
Why am I friends with these people?

49
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,483
Phoebe, come here.

50
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,736
I wanna show you
something in the bathroom.

51
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:23,529
Monica, grow up.

52
00:03:25,197 --> 00:03:31,370
-What's behind your back?
-Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.

53
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,415
-You don't want my opinion?
-Not really.

54
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:37,418
Come on, I'm your older brother.
Ask me.

55
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,420
Okay, big brother.

56
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:45,051
Which one would make your best friend
want to do your little sister?

57
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:52,391
The red one.

58
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,066
Hey.

59
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:04,779
I know you're depressed,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.

60
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:08,574
Right outside is a real,
live, furry playmate.

61
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,953
I'm not sleeping
with your friend Jane again.

62
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:18,918
Hey, a dog!

63
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,588
Who, you gotta admit,
looks a lot like Jane.

64
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:27,593
He's the happiest dog ever.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

65
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:30,888
So you can keep him
till he cheers you up.

66
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,432
I borrow him myself
from time to time..

67
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,476
when I get depressed
thinking about..

68
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,186
world hunger, poverty..

69
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:40,147
Not to trivialize your pain.

70
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:44,568
Thanks so much, Pheebs.
We are gonna have so much fun!

71
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,737
Oh, not that kind of fun.

72
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,330
Happy Valentine's!

73
00:04:56,706 --> 00:05:02,962
I'm slipping into something a bit less
comfortable and a bit more slutty.

74
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,217
"Candy and Cookie"?

75
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,973
"Candy and Cookie"?!

76
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,559
Monica got me porn?

77
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:20,896
Girl-on-girl porn?!

78
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:24,233
She really must love me!

79
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,456
-Yeah, just relax.
-I love you, St. Valentine.

80
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,924
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.

81
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,635
Now push!

82
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,264
Oh, God, it hurts!

83
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:58,851
Worst porn ever!
Worst porn ever!

84
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,230
-Oh, make it stop!
-I am trying!

85
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,818
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!

86
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,988
You're cute, but you're not too smart.

87
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,369
Did I just throw this?

88
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,289
-Hi.
-Hi.

89
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:23,876
I accidentally packed these
with my stuff.

90
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,296
-Who is this?
-Phoebe's friend's dog.

91
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:30,883
I don't know his real name.
I call him Mozzarella.

92
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:37,181
You are so cute. I wish I could play,
but I've gotta go to work.

93
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,811
I hope I stop talking like this
before my meeting. Yes, I do.

94
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:45,731
Bye-bye, Joey.
Seriously, I can't stop it.

95
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:50,611
Come here! Hey!

96
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:55,324
That's Rachel. She used to live here.

97
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:59,495
Might as well be honest with you.
We love her.

98
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,373
But we can't have her.

99
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:05,251
I really miss her.

100
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:09,547
Hey, you understand, right?
You're a guy.

101
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:12,591
Well, you used to be.

102
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:25,104
So, what do you think?

103
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,024
I've still got it.

104
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,778
-Why did you get me this?
-What is it?

105
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:37,825
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.

106
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:41,453
Oh, the dilating!

107
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,543
Is this the video of the birth? It's
Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?

108
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,260
I thought maybe you got me porn
for Valentine's Day.

109
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:02,016
If you thought I was gonna
get you porn for Valentine's Day..

110
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,184
you were right.

111
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,565
It's about a girl who moves
to the city in search of stardom..

112
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:13,110
but ends up having sex
with a lot of guys.

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,778
It got four stars.

114
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:17,406
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.

115
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,869
-Anyway, you wanna take a look?
-Well..

116
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:27,291
-I'm not really in a sexy mood.
-Hey, what's going on?

117
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:30,419
Remember the first time
you saw Jaws..

118
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,673
how long it took
to go back in the water?

119
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:39,637
We can't let this tape
wreck Valentine's Day.

120
00:08:40,137 --> 00:08:41,639
You gotta get past it.

121
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,098
Just get back on the horse.

122
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:47,227
Otherwise, the horse is gonna go into the
bedroom and change into her sweatpants.

123
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:53,651
-Okay, you don't know. You didn't
see it. -Childbirth is beautiful.

124
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,362
Oh, beautiful? Really?

125
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,073
You think this is beautiful?

126
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:06,705
Oh, my God!
No wonder my mother hates me!

127
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,460
-See, honey, there's..
-Don't touch me!

128
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,548
-Hi!
-Hey!

129
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,802
-How was Atlantic City?
-Good.

130
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:22,554
I brought you back a present.

131
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,598
You didn't have to..

132
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,101
Saltwater taffy?!

133
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,895
Thanks.

134
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,982
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater.

135
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:36,402
It's actually made
with salted fresh water.

136
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,447
That's not interesting.

137
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:44,076
-I think it's interesting.
-Me too. I missed you!

138
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,244
Me too.

139
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,288
-How was your week?
-Good.

140
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:50,916
-The baby started kicking.
-How exciting!

141
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,963
It was amazing. The only thing is,
I wasn't there the first time.

142
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,259
-Oh, no.
-I was missing out on all this stuff.

143
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:05,514
-Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
-Yeah, right.

144
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,393
-What?
-Joey cracks me up.

145
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,647
"Have your ex-wife move in.
That wouldn't be awkward."

146
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,946
Imagine, I go away for a few days..

147
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:25,034
and my boyfriend is living
with a woman he got pregnant.

148
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,289
So, what'd you tell him?

149
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,428
You didn't tell Mona
Rachel moved in?

150
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,265
She seemed to think
it was such a crazy idea.

151
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:52,561
Plus, she got me taffy.

152
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,606
-Really? I've never had any.
-Ever?

153
00:10:55,814 --> 00:11:00,694
My mom was too busy planning her
suicide to provide saltwater treats.

154
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,946
Thank you.

155
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:05,699
Are you gonna tell her?

156
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:08,619
I will. I want to butter her up first.

157
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:13,332
I'm gonna take her to dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.

158
00:11:13,582 --> 00:11:16,752
When she thinks
I'm the best boyfriend ever..

159
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:21,006
I'll tell her my pregnant
ex-girlfriend is living with me.

160
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:26,136
If I haven't said it before,
she's a lucky, lucky lady.

161
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:31,183
So where are..?
What the crap is up with this stuff?

162
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:37,064
Is it gum? Is it food?
What's the deal?

163
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,819
Oh, it's nice.
May I try a pink one?

164
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,075
So I just have to plan
the perfect night.

165
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:50,285
Hey, what's the best date
you ever had?

166
00:11:50,786 --> 00:11:54,039
Last year, Greg Hayman took me
to a very nice sushi dinner.

167
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:57,126
Then we took a romantic walk
to a nearby research lab..

168
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,878
where we trashed the place
and freed 20 monkeys.

169
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:05,717
I knew it!
I knew I wasn't crazy!

170
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:09,763
Last year, a monkey
did attack me at the bus stop!

171
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:17,771
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross..

172
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:20,065
it just isn't gonna happen.

173
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:24,570
It'd be like you falling in love
with a cat.

174
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:28,073
-Hey.
-Hey.

175
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:32,995
How's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?

176
00:12:33,871 --> 00:12:35,581
You're subdued.

177
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:39,585
-Did you give him a beer?
-No.

178
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,755
-Will you excuse us? We need to talk.
-Sure.

179
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,967
Oh, me, right.

180
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,473
-He's miserable. What happened to him?
-Nothing.

181
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,101
-We talked about stuff.
-What stuff?

182
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,729
Rachel stuff.

183
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:04,735
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.

184
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,404
He spends a day with you, and look!

185
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,116
He's breathing.

186
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,621
Okay, well, he's watching us
so just look happy, okay?

187
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,004
-I'll take him to Wendy's.
-He's fine.

188
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,339
Look.

189
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:26,965
Here's your ball!

190
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,469
Get your ball!
Get your ball!

191
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:32,971
Get..

192
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,390
Of course.

193
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:37,476
You don't want a tennis ball.

194
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:40,646
Not when you can have a meatball.

195
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,566
Come on, get the meatball.

196
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,697
God, what have I done to you?

197
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:54,576
I broke the dog, Pheebs!
I broke the dog!

198
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,999
Thanks.

199
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:10,676
I'm going to pick up Mona.
What are you doing tonight?

200
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,345
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.

201
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,849
I got my Chinese food on the way,
and your saltwater taffy.

202
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:22,312
Interestingly, it isn't made
with seawater..

203
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:25,816
We actually watched
the documentary together.

204
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,195
Oh, my Chinese food.
I'll get my cash.

205
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,035
Mona?

206
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,872
What are..?
Hi! How are you?

207
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,625
I'm supposed to pick you up.

208
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,713
I made you a Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!

209
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:55,595
-Oh! Hey, Mona!
-Hi, Rachel.

210
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,889
What's she doing here?

211
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,434
I have no idea.

212
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:04,730
I'll be watching TV
if anybody needs me.

213
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,857
What is she doing?

214
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,402
Lately she just likes
hanging out here.

215
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,947
-Why?
-I think she's lonely.

216
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,076
But it's Valentine's Day.
Can't we ask her to go?

217
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,621
Well, no, she's way too emotional.

218
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:25,250
And by emotional, I mean crazy!

219
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,797
That's just my Chinese food.

220
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:33,008
She has food delivered here?

221
00:15:33,258 --> 00:15:38,013
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.

222
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:44,102
I'm gonna get in my sweats
and eat this in bed.

223
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,942
And you thought
she was gonna be in our way!

224
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:55,822
Open the champagne,
and I will be right back.

225
00:15:56,114 --> 00:16:00,410
-I've got a surprise.
-You got another ex-wife back there?

226
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,914
Please start drinking.

227
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,172
-I'm just gonna grab the phone.
-Rachel, wait.

228
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,051
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way.

229
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,638
-What are you doing?
-Do you need the phone?

230
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,682
No.

231
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,852
Ross is too nice to say it,
but this is his apartment.

232
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:30,440
We need boundaries, so why don't
you go back to your place.

233
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:33,652
But, Mona, I live here.

234
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,533
Happy Valentine's Day!

235
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:48,375
Or, something to remember me by.

236
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,970
-How long has it been this time?
-Ninety seconds.

237
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,015
Ninety seconds is a long time
not to think about it.

238
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:06,977
Except all I did was think about it.

239
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,854
I know. It haunts me.

240
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:14,860
Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was
my dad doing shots off the houseboy.

241
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:19,239
After this, I would gladly
make that my screen saver.

242
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:24,536
We have to get past this.
We'll pretend it never existed.

243
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:26,204
I could do that.

244
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:35,213
Now all we gotta do
is get rid of this chair.

245
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,063
-Oh, thank God!
-I know.

246
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,232
Come in!

247
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:57,486
Hi. I'm sorry to barge in
on your Valentine.

248
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:01,448
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.

249
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:04,034
-Oh, my God.
-Poor Ross.

250
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:12,626
We watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.

251
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:17,255
You know that birthing tape
you wanted to see?

252
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,548
It's here.

253
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:22,844
We should warn you before
you watch it. Don't watch it.

254
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,597
You saw it? Is it scary?

255
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:29,309
It's ironic how footage
of someone being born..

256
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:32,562
can make you want to kill yourself.

257
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,526
Honey, she may not have to watch it
but she's going to have to do it.

258
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:41,696
Now I'm all freaked out.
Will you watch it with me?

259
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:46,535
No, but I'll leave a sweater that
smells like me right next to you.

260
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:49,037
Monica, come on.
You want to have kids.

261
00:18:49,204 --> 00:18:51,081
I do.

262
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:53,667
But the stork
is gonna bring mine.

263
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,547
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me watch this alone.

264
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,386
She's right. Of course not.

265
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,763
Honey, get the tape.

266
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:17,816
This reminds me of a very specific
part of the tape.

267
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:22,153
Oh, sure. But if you leave a drumstick
under there and you're a bad roommate.

268
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:25,991
Here we go.

269
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,867
Okay.

270
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,663
Oh, my.

271
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,333
Come on, come on.

272
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,878
Why is that baby torturing that woman?

273
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:42,591
Why have I seen this thing
three times?

274
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:45,844
It's beautiful.

275
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:51,683
-It's horrible!
-I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!

276
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:55,437
What do I do? I don't want to do this!
How do I get out of it?

277
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,901
-You guys! You guys, look!
-What? Did her ass explode?

278
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,531
No, the baby's out. Look.

279
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:12,370
Look at those little fingers and toes.

280
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,706
Look how happy the mom is now.

281
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:20,337
-Oh, Rach.
-Screw you! You don't have to do it!

282
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,217
-Hey.
-Hey!

283
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:30,055
-What's up?
-Mona just dumped me.

284
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,058
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

285
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:37,729
Lately, I haven't exactly been
the perfect boyfriend.

286
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:40,565
I didn't tell her
I got Rachel pregnant.

287
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:45,904
I gave her a key to my apartment
and then had the locks changed.

288
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:49,699
Then I lied to her about Rachel
moving in with me.

289
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,871
In a way, I judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner.

290
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,875
That really sucks.
Especially on Valentine's Day.

291
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:02,754
Wait a minute.
What are you doing here?

292
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,882
Joey without a date
on Valentine's Day?

293
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,427
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

294
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:13,223
-Sort of.
-Really?

295
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,309
You don't have to seem
so happy about it.

296
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,104
Maybe I can help.

297
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:24,275
Whatever it is,
I am sure it has happened to me.

298
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:29,406
You know, actually,
once I got dumped during sex.

299
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:38,456
-So anyway, what is it?
-Forget about it. It's no big deal.

300
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,209
-Come on, what is it?
-It's nothing.

301
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:44,212
Hey, it's me.
Why can't you tell me?

302
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:50,301
Okay. Sit down.

303
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,976
There's this woman that I like a lot.

304
00:21:58,143 --> 00:22:00,311
But it can't happen.

305
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,106
She's not a Tribbiani?

306
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:06,943
No!

307
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,364
So is she someone from work?

308
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,950
Yes.

309
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,494
Well, does she like you?

310
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,832
Sometimes I think she could.

311
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,668
But I can't do anything about it.

312
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:25,003
Why not?

313
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:27,005
It's complicated.

314
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,051
She was with this other guy
for a long time.

315
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,511
Someone from work too.

316
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:38,558
I could never do that to the guy.
We're friends.

317
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,352
Wait, I thought you
hated everyone at work.

318
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:44,606
No, no. I only say that..

319
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:49,694
so Chandler won't feel threatened
because I'm his only friend.

320
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:54,032
Excuse me?

321
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,659
Sorry, sorry.
And I'm your only friend too.

322
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:05,835
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?

323
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,922
-No, I don't think so.
-Okay.

324
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:10,924
Is he a good guy?

325
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,511
Yeah, he's the best.

326
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,430
-Then talk to him.
-I don't know.

327
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,850
It's worth finding out,
if you like her.

328
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:22,685
I do, so much.

329
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:25,730
I can't stop thinking about her.
I can't sleep..

330
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:29,442
You know what?
You have to go for it.

331
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:34,823
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.

332
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,492
Here's your warm milk.

333
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:45,083
I'm gonna put the bourbon
in it at home.

334
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:52,048
Anyway, seriously,
just talk to the guy, okay?

335
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:54,717
Let me know how it goes.

336
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:58,054
It's Rachel.

337
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:11,025
You're having a baby
and you need to prepare.

338
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:16,155
You're gonna make yourself watch
the whole thing. Just do it!

339
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:22,912
I came to the big city
to become a star.

340
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:27,750
-I'll do anything to make that happen.
-Anything?

341
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:32,463
Maybe it starts with
how she gets pregnant.

342
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,760
I wonder which one of these guys
becomes the father.

343
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:43,141
No, no.
Can't get pregnant that way.
