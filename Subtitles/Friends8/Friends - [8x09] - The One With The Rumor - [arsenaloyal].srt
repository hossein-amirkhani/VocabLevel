1
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:11,504
Did you know that during pregnancy..

2
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:17,009
your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

3
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:19,846
Oh, my God! Let me see that.

4
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:24,142
You fall for it every time.

5
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:28,020
Hey! I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

6
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:33,192
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute!

7
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:37,613
Look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

8
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:43,119
And after the baby's born
they're great for shoplifting melons.

9
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:48,499
Good, you're all here.
Thanksgiving, 4:00.

10
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:53,129
Guess who I invited? Remember
Will Culvert from high school?

11
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:56,007
-No.
-He was in Ross' class.

12
00:00:56,215 --> 00:01:00,887
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Really overweight.

13
00:01:01,137 --> 00:01:02,722
I was his thin friend.

14
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:09,353
I don't remember. Are you talking
about your imaginary boyfriend?

15
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:12,523
No, that was Jared.

16
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:17,528
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

17
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:24,243
Will's here on business, and he didn't have
a place to go, so I invited him here.

18
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:28,831
-That's nice.
-Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,543
He looks good.
Okay, I mean really gorgeous.

20
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:41,719
-I still love Chandler.
-Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.

21
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:46,682
Just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey this year..

22
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,602
-What?
-Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,232
-Phoebe! -Turkeys are
beautiful, intelligent animals.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,529
No, they're not! They're ugly
and stupid and delicious!

25
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,656
Plus, eating them is like a tradition.

26
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:06,619
It goes back to the first Thanksgiving when
the Indians sat down with the cowboys.

27
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:12,542
Oh, right. That's when they had
that big rodeo at Plymouth Rock.

28
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,171
It's not just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet,
Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food..

29
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,758
-Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.
-She is?

30
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,345
Yeah. Remember? I had to leave
the other day when you had that chicken.

31
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,806
I thought that was
because I put the whole thing..

32
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,183
on my hand
and made it walk across the table.

33
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:35,356
It's not worth it to make a whole turkey
for just three people. It's a lot of work.

34
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,025
But you gotta have turkey
on Thanksgiving!

35
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:42,989
Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
Fourth of July with no apple pie.

36
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,409
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

37
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,038
Fine, if it means that much to you.
But there's gonna be a ton left over.

38
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:53,791
No. I promise I will finish that turkey.

39
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,920
You're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,093
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
This is what we do.

41
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:08,306
We may not be great
thinkers or world leaders..

42
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:13,269
we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!

43
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,974
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.

44
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:57,813
Isn't it weird how next year
there will be a baby at the table?

45
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:04,570
Rachel's. But good to know
where you're at.

46
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,572
-Hey!
-Hey!

47
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:08,741
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too!

48
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,868
-Can I help?
-Yes.

49
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,163
Chandler usually helps,
but he's into the game.

50
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:19,377
Could you fold these napkins? I'm gonna
go across the hall to check on the yams.

51
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,381
No, sweetie. No, not like that.

52
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,717
We're not at a barn dance.

53
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:30,596
Fold them like swans.
I showed you at Christmas. Remember?

54
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

55
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,398
-So how's the game?
-I have no idea.

56
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,900
-What?
-I'm pretending to watch..

57
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,277
so I don't have to help out.

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,284
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!

59
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,704
-And Monica has no idea?
-No.

60
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,124
Once in a while,
I just yell stuff at the TV.

61
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,128
Hey! What? Aw! Hey!

62
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,383
-Your team winning?
-Anderson just scored again.

63
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:10,428
There is no Anderson.

64
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:14,849
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

65
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:19,395
I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.

66
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:22,523
-You like football?
-Normally, I don't.

67
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:26,652
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

68
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:31,490
-You like Green Bay?
-It's only my favorite bay.

69
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:47,173
-Happy Thanksgiving.
-Will, I'm so glad that you came.

70
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,258
You look great. You must've lost..

71
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,180
150 pounds. I'll be on one of those
Subway commercials.

72
00:05:56,182 --> 00:06:00,561
-A pie!
-It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

73
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:04,315
-It's no good. Throw it out.
-Meet some people.

74
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,526
This is my husband, Chandler.
This is Will.

75
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:12,531
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand
but I'm really into the game.

76
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:17,453
Plus, it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand next to each other.

77
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,040
-This is Phoebe.
-Hi.

78
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,377
Hey. Wow!

79
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,882
Well done.

80
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:35,304
-Wanna give me a hand?
-I can't get over how great you look.

81
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:41,227
-You look incredible too. You're so fit.
-I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.

82
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,482
-I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
-Great, I love Ross.

83
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,568
Good. And Rachel Greene too.

84
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,367
-Is there a problem?
-No. It's okay.

85
00:06:56,617 --> 00:07:00,538
It's just.. God, I hated her.

86
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:02,748
-What?
-I hated her.

87
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:06,168
She was horrible to me in high school.

88
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:12,299
But hey, that was a long time ago. I'm in
a good place. Might be fun to see her again.

89
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,053
Got any cakes or cookies
or something?

90
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:20,474
No, Will! No!

91
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,269
It's been a while since we screamed.
Maybe we should.

92
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,522
-Oh, okay. No!
-Come on!

93
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:30,651
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!

94
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:38,617
What are you doing?
You've got an entire turkey to eat.

95
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:42,454
Let me explain to you how
the human body works.

96
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,457
I have to warm up my stomach first.

97
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,336
-Eating chips is like stretching.
-Okay.

98
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:54,425
-Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
-I'm here to tell you something.

99
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:58,971
You can eat and eat, but nothing
will ever fill that void.

100
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:05,978
-Who the hell is this guy?
-This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.

101
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,147
-Want some chips?
-No.

102
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,734
-Will!
-Ross!

103
00:08:11,984 --> 00:08:17,865
Hey, you came!
Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!

104
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:22,286
-Hot stuff?
-It's good to see you, man.

105
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:25,289
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?

106
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,793
-I'm a commodities broker.
-That sounds interesting.

107
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,588
-Yeah, it's not.
-Oh.

108
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,925
-But I'm rich and thin.
-Oh.

109
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:40,846
I haven't seen you since
Lance Davis' graduation party.

110
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:42,848
That was such a fun night.

111
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:47,269
Would've been good if we had
gotten in, but still fun.

112
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:52,149
We were lame. Do you remember
how into dinosaurs we were?

113
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,821
-Yeah.
-So, what do you do now?

114
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:02,201
So how long are you in town?

115
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,956
-Hi.
-Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

116
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,666
Rachel Greene.

117
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,128
Oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

118
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:19,468
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just..
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!

119
00:09:21,512 --> 00:09:23,806
High school was a long time ago.

120
00:09:24,014 --> 00:09:27,101
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

121
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:32,898
My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene
and complex carbohydrates.

122
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,193
Oh, my God. Who is that?

123
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:42,741
-That's Will, from high school.
-Oh! I do not remember him.

124
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:48,455
Wow, really got that sexy
smoldering thing going on.

125
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:56,422
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

126
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:59,258
He's trying to mouth something to me.

127
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,178
I hate you!

128
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,640
-Okay, dinner's ready!
-Okay!

129
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:10,728
-Solid effort. Solid effort.
-Oh, so who won?

130
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,272
-Green Bay.
-Detroit.

131
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,025
-What?
-The Lions technically won.

132
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:21,196
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

133
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:28,370
Hi! Will, right?
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.

134
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,667
-Oh, I remember you.
-Really? Aren't you sweet?

135
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:39,048
I gotta tell you, I'm having
the hardest time placing you.

136
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:41,675
Hang on! I think I remember you.

137
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:47,389
Did we fool around at
Lance Davis' graduation party?

138
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:51,310
-You are unbelievable.
-Thank you.

139
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,483
Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And Will, you sit way over there.

140
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,825
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that. No problem.

141
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:12,331
-At least give me a challenge.
-This is Chandler's chicken.

142
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:17,086
This is the turkey.

143
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:21,215
Oh. How big is that?

144
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:26,887
-About 19 pounds.
-It's like me when I was born.

145
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:33,018
-Who would like some yams? Will?
-You'd like that, wouldn't you?

146
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:37,606
What? Oh, can we please keep
the chicken..

147
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:40,359
and the turkey on the other side?

148
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:44,321
-The smell is just..
-Typical.

149
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,492
-What?
-I said it was typical.

150
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:54,873
Typical of you. Queen Rachel does
whatever she wants in Rachel-land.

151
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:01,130
Seriously, who is this guy?

152
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:05,300
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?

153
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:10,556
-I don't know. Do I? Do I?
-I think you do.

154
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,893
You were a little mean
to him in high school.

155
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:19,815
-A little mean? You made my life miserable.
-I had no idea. I'm sorry.

156
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:23,735
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

157
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:25,737
But you worked so hard.

158
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,407
-Yams!
-Okay.

159
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:35,706
I'm real sorry for whatever
I did to you in high school.

160
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,834
It wasn't just me. We had a club.

161
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:43,964
-You had a club?
-The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!

162
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:47,843
So you all just joined together
to hate me?

163
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:52,347
-Who else was in this club?
-Me and Ross.

164
00:12:56,852 --> 00:13:00,731
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

165
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:11,325
-You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
-Yes, he was.

166
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,784
No, no.

167
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:20,375
-So who else was in this club?
-That exchange student from Thailand.

168
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:24,755
But I don't think he knew what it was.

169
00:13:25,047 --> 00:13:27,299
You guys were cool.

170
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,927
So, Ross, we went out for two years..

171
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:32,930
and you never told me you were
in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?

172
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:36,558
You went out with her? We had a pact.

173
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:43,899
-It's not like it was binding forever.
-It had the word "eternity" in it.

174
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:48,195
I'm thinking of joining
an "I Hate Turkey Club."

175
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:50,989
Although, I do love a turkey club.

176
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,786
Monica? Did you know about this?

177
00:13:56,036 --> 00:14:00,165
I didn't. Is that why
you used to lock the bedroom door?

178
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,877
-Yeah.
-A little relieved, I gotta say.

179
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:10,384
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

180
00:14:10,676 --> 00:14:13,053
-The only reason I joined..
-Cofounded.

181
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,055
Cofounded.

182
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:20,102
Cofounded the club,
was that I was in love with you.

183
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:24,356
I didn't handle it very well. If you think
about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club"..

184
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:27,568
was really
the "I Love Rachel Club."

185
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:30,946
Except that it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

186
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:35,492
So you'd get together
and say mean things about me?

187
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:40,038
-We did a little more than that.
-No, no, no.

188
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,957
What else did you do?

189
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:46,336
-We started a rumor.
-What rumor?

190
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:50,591
Come on, Will,
just take off your shirt and tell us.

191
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,555
-Ross?
-It was no big deal.

192
00:14:56,805 --> 00:15:02,561
We said that.. The rumor was that..

193
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:08,191
you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

194
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:11,361
-What?
-That's right. We said your parents..

195
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:18,076
flipped a coin, decided to raise you
as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.

196
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:21,079
-Oh, my God!
-You started that?

197
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,834
-You heard that?
-Everyone at our school heard it!

198
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:29,338
Everyone at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?

199
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:31,506
Oh, no!

200
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,095
It makes sense now. This is why
Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.

201
00:15:37,346 --> 00:15:40,349
Why Billy would just stay
in this region.

202
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:44,728
Billy's gay now, so that one's
not really our fault.

203
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:49,524
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I thought it might be true.

204
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:54,112
I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

205
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:03,246
Stop staring! There's nothing there!
It's not true!

206
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:05,874
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

207
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,710
Come on, whip it out.

208
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:28,647
You are my Everest.

209
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:33,235
-You don't have to finish.
-I do. Otherwise, what's next?

210
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:38,698
Today I can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I eat half a PowerBar..

211
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:42,202
wrap it up and put it
in the fridge? No!

212
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:47,666
I gotta change my pants. What was
I thinking? Jeans have no give.

213
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,712
Guys, help me with the dishes.
There's a lot of pots and pans.

214
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,548
Honey, I'd love to,
but the second game is about to start.

215
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:59,428
Oh, yeah, the second game.
More football for the Pheebster.

216
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,847
-Who's playing?
-Los Angeles.

217
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,850
Last time I checked,
Los Angeles didn't have a football team.

218
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,895
Did I say Los Angeles? I meant the team
that used to be in Los Angeles..

219
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,816
and is now in St. Louis.
I actually knew that.

220
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:15,944
Okay, quick, name three players
on that team.

221
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,571
Gretzky..

222
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,032
Agassi..

223
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,829
I'm a pretty little girl.

224
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:35,005
Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

225
00:17:35,213 --> 00:17:40,177
"Dear Rach, you're such a great
person." Not girl, "person."

226
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:44,222
I think you're reading a little
too much into it.

227
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:48,351
"You're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."

228
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,565
What do you want me to do..

229
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:56,943
call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?

230
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:59,696
-Yes.
-Also, tell them I'm skinny now.

231
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:02,783
Oh! Me too!

232
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:06,536
I won't call anybody.
It was a million years ago.

233
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:12,209
I don't care. You told people
that I was half and half!

234
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:16,213
I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

235
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,840
That's not totally true.

236
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,342
-What?
-What?

237
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,345
You did start that rumor about Ross..

238
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:28,350
making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

239
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,102
How did you know that?

240
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:37,651
-It's true?
-No.

241
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:42,364
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.

242
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:47,577
-Hey, what were you doing in the library?
-They had magazines.

243
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:50,247
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out..

244
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:54,584
with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
before he went back to Thailand.

245
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,381
In high school you made out
with a 50-year-old woman?

246
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:03,760
-Hey, she didn't look 50!
-Did she look 16?

247
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,139
There's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

248
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,519
-Wow.
-She didn't photograph well!

249
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:15,146
She probably wasn't familiar
with the process..

250
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:18,400
having spent most of her life sitting
for oil paintings.

251
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:24,614
How did this happen? Did she lure
you to an early-bird dinner?

252
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:36,293
I was working late in the library
one afternoon. It was just the two of us.

253
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:40,463
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

254
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:44,634
And one thing led to another.

255
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:50,849
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

256
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,313
May she rest in peace.

257
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:02,152
-Didn't she walk with a cane?
-Only when it was damp!

258
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:07,616
I can't believe you told people
about this. Everybody knew?

259
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:12,203
-You know what? I'm back in the club!
-Yeah!

260
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,290
-Shall I call the meeting to order?
-Is everybody present?

261
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,918
With the exception of Ta-Taka.

262
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,920
-I wanna join!
-Phoebe?

263
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,507
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
I didn't go to high school.

264
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:29,387
But three of us would meet behind
a dumpster to learn French.

265
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:32,515
Fine, you can have
your stupid, little club.

266
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:37,145
But what you did to me is way worse
than what I did to you.

267
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:40,815
-You gave me a teeny weenie.
-Yeah!

268
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:47,989
You're just being silly.
Rachel, even with that rumor..

269
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:52,452
you were one of the most popular girls.
Everyone wanted to be like you.

270
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:56,498
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.

271
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,500
Wow.

272
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:04,047
And Ross, if it weren't for her rumor,
no one would've known who you were.

273
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:09,260
-She put you on the map.
-As a romancer of the elderly.

274
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,682
Mrs. Altmann, you can tell,
she used to be pretty.

275
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,936
The eyes did still sparkle.

276
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:23,274
This stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.

277
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:27,278
You got so much more
important stuff going on in your life.

278
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,990
Can't you just let this go?

279
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,204
-She's right.
-We are having a baby together.

280
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:38,331
Hold on.

281
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:42,293
-You got her pregnant?
-Yeah.

282
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,130
-Are you getting married?
-No.

283
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:50,051
So you knocked her up but you're
not gonna marry her. Dude.

284
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:56,266
-Anybody?
-Okay.

285
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:03,314
It's exactly how I imagined
it would be.

286
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,778
All right, where's that turkey?

287
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,164
-Those are my maternity pants!
-No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

288
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,840
Well, that's it. I'm done.

289
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,344
Here come the meat sweats.

290
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:40,560
Well, Joey, we're all
very proud of you.

291
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,731
I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

292
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:50,153
-Anything we can do?
-No. Just nobody press on my stomach.

293
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:53,364
You can keep those pants, by the way.

294
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:58,703
What you got there?
What is that, pie?

295
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:03,041
-Yeah. You want some?
-Just cut me a little sliver.

296
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:07,378
