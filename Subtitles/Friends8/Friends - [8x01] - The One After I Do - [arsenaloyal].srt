1
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:06,758
Oh, my God, we did it!

2
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:09,844
We just got married. Right there!

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,180
Is that your ring?

4
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,227
We're off to a good start.

5
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,981
-And, you sure you're not pregnant?
-Yeah. I'm sure.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,984
But if you're ready to have kids
we got a room upstairs.

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,029
I mean, I'll blow off
this party right now. I'll do it!

8
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,332
Okay, you guys,
that ceremony was so beautiful.

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:43,211
Was it?! Was it perfect?!
Is it too soon to see the video?!

10
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:49,050
Can we just please take a moment?
Our two best friends just got married.

11
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:53,680
We are so blessed to be able
to share in this incredible joy.

12
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,182
That is so true.

13
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,811
Mon, is it too late to switch
from chicken to steak?

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:06,359
I'm so happy for you guys.
And you are both so lucky!

15
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:10,029
I mean, you both said the right names

16
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:14,158
And nobody was drunk.

17
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,577
Okay.

18
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,413
And nobody was gay.

19
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,542
And on your first try.

20
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,293
Great. Great.
Just give me a sec to change film.

21
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,340
I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited for you.

22
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,259
-What's going on?
-Monica's pregnant.

23
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,930
Oh, my God. Is that why
you guys had to get married?

24
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:22,602
-Guys, I'm not pregnant.
-Oh, slow swimmers?

25
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,231
What?! What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?

26
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,943
-You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
-No.

27
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,654
I'll be right back.

28
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,949
You. Take a lot of pictures.

29
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,952
Why don't we get a shot of Monica
and the bloody soldier.

30
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,039
About that, Joey, you have
to change before the party.

31
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:46,459
-I can't. I don't have any other
clothes here. -Find some, please.

32
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:50,546
Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."

33
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,466
-Fine!
-And be careful who you hug, okay?

34
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:58,012
My father's upstairs in tears
because you got blood on his dress.

35
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,392
Why don't we see the bride and
the groom, and the bridesmaids.

36
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,397
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys
that you weren't pregnant?

37
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,233
-Because I'm not.
-We found your tests.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,110
If you're not pregnant..

39
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,991
it's because I am.

40
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,370
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,998
Yes, I am with child.

42
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,961
I didn't want to say anything
because it's your day.

43
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,965
-I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
-So you told people I was pregnant?

44
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,343
Does this look like a conversation
I want to remember?

45
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,513
-Who's the father?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,515
I can't say.

47
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,058
-Why?
-Why not?

48
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,062
I can't say because he's famous.

49
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,232
Oh, my God. Who is it?

50
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,444
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,905
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.

52
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,201
James Brolin is the father of my baby.

53
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,621
As in Barbra Streisand's husband
James Brolin?

54
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,707
What?!

55
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,084
Well, he never said that to me.

56
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,423
Monica, if you step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,633
How about just the bridesmaids?

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,261
I am the groom.
I was told it was a big deal.

59
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,221
-It is.
-Yeah.

60
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,641
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,686
Thank you for that.
I can't deal with the stress quite yet.

62
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:30,730
Instead you told me
Monica was pregnant?

63
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,524
You said she was.
I didn't disagree with you.

64
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,193
Sneaky.

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,570
Smile, ladies!

66
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,991
-By the way, James Brolin?
-I know.

67
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:46,078
I could only think of two names:
him and Ed Begley Jr.

68
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:52,376
-Then I remembered he's gay, so..
-Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.

69
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:53,961
Really?

70
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,342
Congratulations!

71
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,345
Look who's married!
And just in time too, I hear.

72
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,846
What? Ross!

73
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:09,936
So if you've got this all under
control, I'm just gonna..

74
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:15,024
I just wanted you to know
that you have made us happier

75
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:17,360
You have given us more joy..

76
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,237
I'm not pregnant.

77
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,696
What?

78
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,158
I'm not pregnant.

79
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,370
Oh, well.

80
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,790
But I did still get married today.

81
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,625
Whatever.

82
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,638
Thank you very much.

83
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:49,851
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to introduce to you:

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,645
Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing.

85
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:03,573
-Before we go out there, I got a present.
-I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

86
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,243
-No. I've been taking dancing lessons.
-What?

87
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,497
For the last six weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.

88
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,249
That is so sweet.

89
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,836
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?

90
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,296
Yes.

91
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,679
-What's the matter?
-It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.

92
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,599
-Are you gonna be able to do this?
-Not well.

93
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,901
Well, the good news is,
I don't think anyone's looking at us.

94
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:43,654
So are you ready to talk about it?

95
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,740
No.

96
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,659
Now?

97
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,370
No!

98
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,415
-We'll talk about something else then.
-Thank you.

99
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,542
Who's the father?

100
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,920
Honey, I haven't told him yet..

101
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,882
so, until I do, I don't think
I should tell anybody else.

102
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,134
That's fine. That's fair.

103
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,428
-Is it Tag?
-Phoebe!

104
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,805
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.

105
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,641
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

106
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,769
-Oh, my God, it's Joey!
-Stop it. Okay?

107
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,647
I am not gonna tell you
until I tell him.

108
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,899
At least we know it's a him.

109
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,115
Oh, sweet Lord.

110
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,701
I'm sorry, okay?
I went down to the gift shop.

111
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,080
It was either this or a bathrobe.
What's more important:

112
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,749
The way I'm dressed,
or being with you today?

113
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,586
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey!

114
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,722
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
I'm Monica's older brother.

115
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:55,017
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.

116
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,938
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.

117
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,070
Mona. What a beautiful name.

118
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,989
You think so?
I always kind of hated it.

119
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,450
Come on! Mona Lisa.

120
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,077
Mona...

121
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,830
Llegglachen.

122
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,166
The famous botanist.

123
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:23,337
Oh, no, she's..
Well, she's dead now, but..

124
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:28,467
Supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.

125
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,885
Really?

126
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:34,181
-See, I never knew about her.
-Linda Llegglachen..

127
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,646
So, what table are you at?

128
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,941
Me too.

129
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,069
Good. Now there'll be someone there
who likes my name.

130
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,071
Yes, there will.

131
00:08:55,745 --> 00:09:01,042
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

132
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,921
And if it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.

133
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,549
Martin Llegglachen.

134
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:14,346
That's better. Now, just bend your arms
a little bit. Now look straight ahead.

135
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,933
This time I want you
to really put your ass into it.

136
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,690
Who's slippery now?

137
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:30,404
Isn't that just the best feeling?
Rubbing a fork on the bottom of your shoe?

138
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:35,284
Chandler, darling, look,
my date has finally arrived.

139
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:40,206
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Dennis, this is my son, Chandler.

140
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,708
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

141
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,086
Dennis is a dear old friend..

142
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,255
and a fantastic lover.

143
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,343
Are my ears bleeding?

144
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:57,598
Don't mind Chandler.
He's always been shy.

145
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,058
Oh, you're right.

146
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,561
Bravo, Dennis.
Thanks for pleasing my mother so.

147
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,525
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
I was stuck at auditions.

148
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,611
Yes, Dennis is directing
a new Broadway show.

149
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,905
I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.

150
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:16,075
-Dennis Phillips.
-I've admired your work for years.

151
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,245
-You've done some really amazing stuff.
-Thank you.

152
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,997
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go get myself a drink.

153
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,666
I'll be back in a moment.

154
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,795
Okay. You stop.

155
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,301
Dennis Phillips. That's great.
How did you guys meet?

156
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:39,014
-Well, it's a funny story.
-Funny, "ha-ha"? Or funny:

157
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,903
Thank you. If everyone will please
take your seats, dinner will be served.

158
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:09,003
-I thought you were at table six.
-No. Nine.

159
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:16,927
See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way..

160
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,638
which was misleading.

161
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,984
Hello.

162
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:42,870
Will you see if your mom can give
my resume to Dennis Phillips?

163
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:48,375
Well, they've kind of locked themselves in
one of the men's room stalls right now.

164
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,670
Perhaps when they get out.

165
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,507
If I could get in a Broadway show,
then I would've done it all.

166
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,468
Film, television and theater.

167
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:01,096
The only thing left would be radio.
But that's just for ugly people.

168
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,851
-What size shoes do you wear?
-Eleven, 11¨ö.

169
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,980
My shoes give me a problem on the
dance floor. Can I borrow your boots?

170
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,233
I don't really even know
where I left those.

171
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,198
-Those aren't 11 ¨ö.
-Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

172
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:23,702
I have surprisingly small feet. But
the rest of me is good. I'll show you.

173
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,209
Who am I kidding?
I belong in radio.

174
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:38,342
-Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
-Let's not talk about that right now.

175
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,429
-This is so huge.
-Sure, but as big as your wedding?

176
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,057
Of course not. Nothing is.

177
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,811
Between me and you,
in this day and age..

178
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,355
how dumb do you have to be
to get pregnant?

179
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,859
Sometimes you can do everything right.
Everyone wears what they're supposed to..

180
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,779
and one of those little guys
just gets through.

181
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,117
-How?
-I don't know. Maybe they have tools.

182
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,830
Well, I talked to her, and she's
definitely gonna have the baby.

183
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,874
She said she's gonna
raise it on her own.

184
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,545
-Well, maybe that's really brave.
-Maybe.

185
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:18,007
I just hope she realizes how hard
it's gonna be.

186
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,762
Maybe she hasn't really thought it
through that much.

187
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,181
Well, there's a lot to think about.

188
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:31,645
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?

189
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:36,900
Does she realize she's not gonna have
a date again for the next, like, 18 years?

190
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,739
I don't know.

191
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,200
Are you okay?

192
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:51,415
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

193
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,586
-Champagne?
-Oh, yes! Thank you very much.

194
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,561
That's actually how the French drink it.

195
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:21,195
Well, I just got off the phone
with my lover James Brolin.

196
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,450
-Oh, really?
-Apparently, he is married to some singer.

197
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:33,332
But he said he'd leave her for me.
And I said, "James Brolin, are you sure?"

198
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,335
-James Brolin said..
-Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

199
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,128
What?!

200
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,840
Why bother?

201
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,803
-How do you feel?
-I don't know how I feel.

202
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,641
This is all happening so fast. I have to make
all these decisions that I don't wanna make.

203
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,268
Someone just take this away from me!

204
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:57,022
-Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
-What?!

205
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,360
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took that test, like, three times.

206
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:06,281
Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

207
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,575
How many ways are there to do that?

208
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,705
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're 100 percent sure.

209
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:17,501
All right, I'll take it again
when I get home.

210
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,753
I can wait until then.

211
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:25,134
Oh, this is such a good party.
How late does it go till?

212
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,304
-You gotta take it now.
-No, this your wedding.

213
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:33,851
You're not gonna be able to have fun
until we know. Do it as a present to me.

214
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,186
Okay, thank you.

215
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,523
-I'll run out and get you one.
-You girls are so great.

216
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,068
-Wait a minute. Who's the father?
-She won't tell us.

217
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,113
Come on! It's my wedding.
That could be my present!

218
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,285
-I just gave you peeing on a stick.
-See, this is why you register.

219
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,587
It was the chair again. Okay?
I'm not doing it!

220
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:06,008
Dad. Can't you go back to your table?

221
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:12,764
No. Apparently little Molly Gilbert is
enjoying her grown-up salmon en croute.

222
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,776
Look, I don't..
You know what?

223
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,243
-Would you like to dance?
-Sure.

224
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,828
Great.

225
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,041
-Dr. Geller.
-I wasn't farting!

226
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,047
A little game from our table.

227
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,009
Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

228
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:55,724
Maybe later. Right now,
I'm about to dance with this lady.

229
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:05,150
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

230
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,153
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

231
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,365
Yes, I am.

232
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,662
In fact, let's try my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

233
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,248
-Sure.
-Yeah? Hop on.

234
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,923
Is the pretty lady looking?
Keep dancing.

235
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,062
And the world will never know.

236
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,983
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

237
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,820
I told him how talented you were
and all about Days of our Lives.

238
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:54,366
You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.

239
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,618
But you're not just a soap actor.

240
00:17:56,785 --> 00:18:00,455
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

241
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,378
He has no idea
what kind of range I have.

242
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,922
Don't move.

243
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,177
It's like he's running
on tiny little pegs.

244
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,103
-Thank you.
-No, thank you, Miranda.

245
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,855
-Melinda.
-All right.

246
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:30,986
-How cute was that?
-Oh, were you watching?

247
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,156
Can I go next?

248
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,076
Of course you can. Hop on.

249
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,204
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.

250
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,964
-I am so gonna score.
-What?

251
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,383
I like your bow.

252
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:03,101
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler..

253
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:07,606
the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

254
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:12,569
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

255
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:17,866
I was like, "Why, God? Why?
How can you take them away from me!"

256
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:25,457
But then I thought back over all our
memories together. Some happy memories.

257
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,630
And there were some sad memories.

258
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,635
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,888
And some scared memories.

260
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:51,024
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

261
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,903
Their friend who can speak
in many dialects..

262
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,741
and has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

263
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,286
To the happy couple.

264
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,130
-Thank you.
-That was very nice, Ashley.

265
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,382
-Can we do it again?
-No, no.

266
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,554
-So, is it my turn now?
-I'm next.

267
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:27,978
-That's okay, you can dance with her first.
-Are you sure?

268
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,024
-So, what's your name?
-Gert.

269
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,193
That's pretty.

270
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,327
What are you doing there, Gert?

271
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,957
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls did it.

272
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,921
Hop on, Gert.

273
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,346
-Why aren't you moving your feet?
-I'm trying.

274
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,226
Faster. You're not going fast enough.

275
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,104
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

276
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:19,362
So did you happen to catch
my toast up there?

277
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,367
-Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
-There was a little something for everyone.

278
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:29,998
-I know you're casting for this new show.
-I don't think you're right for this project.

279
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,750
You're wrong.

280
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,754
Whatever it is, I can do it. If you
didn't see it up there, just try me.

281
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:40,091
It's an all Chinese cast.
Can you be Chinese?

282
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:46,932
-Well, I'm not proud of this, but..
-Oh, my God. Please don't!

283
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:53,188
-Ready to get back to the dance floor?
-Did it turn into sand?

284
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:58,777
-Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine.
-No. No, I won't.

285
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,655
Do you know why
I took all those lessons?

286
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:06,451
I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen on the dance floor..

287
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,119
with some clumsy idiot.

288
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,206
Oh, sweetie,
you could never embarrass me.

289
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:15,961
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
But it doesn't matter, all right?

290
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,712
I married you.

291
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,132
No matter what you do,
I'm gonna come home with you, okay?

292
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,469
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on.

293
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:29,599
But I'll tell you, that's the last time I buy
shoes at the Slippery Fun Shoe store.

294
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,521
Just try not to move your feet at all.

295
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,405
There you go.

296
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,909
-I'm gonna have you arrested.
-Why?

297
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,619
You stole my moves!

298
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,376
Oh, Chandler, you're quite the dancer!

299
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,755
-Thanks, Mrs. Geller.
-Oh, come on, you can call me Mom.

300
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,591
Really?

301
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,009
I will.

302
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,190
Sorry, Mom.

303
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,363
-How much longer?
-30 seconds.

304
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,198
Thirty seconds, okay..

305
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,200
Did I miss it?

306
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:39,878
I want you to know that
if it's positive, we're gonna..

307
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,923
-I know. I know.
-You do. Okay.

308
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,052
It's time.

309
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,392
Go ahead, Rach.

310
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,731
Wait. You know what? I can't
look at it. Somebody else tell me.

311
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,112
It's negative.

312
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,575
-What?
-It's negative.

313
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,086
Well, there you go.

314
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:30,345
That is.. That's great.
That is really great, great news.

315
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,685
You know, because the whole..

316
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:42,107
not being ready and, kind of,
the financial aspects, all that..

317
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,780
This is so just the way
that this was supposed to be.

318
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,119
Then, great.

319
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,291
God, this is so stupid.

320
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:06,089
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

321
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,677
-It's negative?
-No, it's positive.

322
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,769
-What?
-It's not negative, it's positive.

323
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,357
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I lied before.

324
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,199
-Now you know how you really feel about it.
-That's a risky little game.

325
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:38,830
Are you really gonna do this?

326
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,666
Yeah.

327
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,793
I'm gonna have a baby.

328
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,005
I'm gonna have a baby.

329
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,174
I'm gonna have a baby!

330
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:59,017
-With who?
-No, it's still not the time.

331
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,028
I just didn't see the fast song coming.

332
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:14,282
Don't talk, we'll get you up to your
room, soak your feet. You'll be okay.

333
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,118
-Thank you.
-That is so sweet!

334
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:20,955
No, I mean it. There are so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

335
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:25,001
Tell me about it. I feel like I'm
holding down the fort by myself.

336
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,463
-It's Joey, right?
-Yeah.

337
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,381
Wait a minute! No!

338
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,133
I'm the nice one!

339
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,554
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night. I..

340
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,681
How small are your feet?!
