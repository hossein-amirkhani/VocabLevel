1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:06,380
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a little baby?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,674
We could call it Chuck.

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,219
Or Dick.

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,681
- Hey.
Hey.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,392
Listen, I need a favor.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,729
I was in the shower, and as I was...

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,482
...cleansing myself, I, uh...
Well, I felt something.

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,861
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,157
No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

10
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,992
Well, what was it?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,954
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not...

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:43,208
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,626
...could help me out.

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,503
- Whoa!
- Whoa! No.

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,131
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,050
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,469
Huh.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,221
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

19
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,851
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

20
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,228
Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?

21
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,150
No, it's...

22
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,652
...fancier than a pimple.

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,821
- Look, Ross, just go see a doc...
- Guys, what's...?

24
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,080
Okay, well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

25
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,623
- Yeah, right.
- Ah.

26
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,387
And, um, this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

27
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,556
- Good deal.
- Yeah, and these are my friends.

28
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,975
People? This is Vince.
Vince, the people.

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,309
Hi.

30
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,312
- Hey.
- Vince is a fireman.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,941
Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building before?

32
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,569
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

33
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,737
Well, you know, if Joey and I
play with matches...

34
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,823
...we could get you up to an even 100.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,536
- Fire safety is not a joke, son.
- Ha, ha. Oh.

36
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,707
You're right. I know.

37
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,543
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.

38
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,670
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,674
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,926
But I thought you just started dating
that teacher.

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,178
- Oh, Jason?
Yeah.

42
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,388
Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight.
Ahem.

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,223
Well, Pheebs?

44
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,059
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

45
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:09,730
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field, you know?

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,817
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?

47
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:18,280
You know, this kind of, like, you know,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

48
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,282
So, Pheebs, do they know
about each other?

49
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,243
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

50
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,666
Okay, no, they don't know.

51
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,712
- Hey, guys.
Hi.

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,217
Well?
- How'd it go at the doctor's?

53
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:42,304
Well, he said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

54
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,806
- Well, what is it?
- He couldn't even tell me.

55
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:50,604
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

56
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,441
And the worse thing is, he said
not being able to identify it...

57
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,360
...he was reluctant to remove it.

58
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,278
You know what?
You should go to my guy.

59
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,864
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple...

60
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,201
...he just lopped it right off, you know?
- Yeah?

61
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,328
- So I guess I'm lucky.
- Heh.

62
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,540
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

63
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,878
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

64
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,590
Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.

65
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,843
You know? They'd call it The Ross.

66
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,555
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

67
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,309
Yeah, that'd be cool.

68
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,938
Pete's breaking up with me.

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,273
What?

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,358
Yeah, I just checked my messages.

71
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,945
He said that when he gets back
from Atlanta, "We need to talk. "

72
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,863
- And?
Well, that's it.

73
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,409
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

74
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,495
Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

75
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,997
Yeah.
- Really?

76
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,833
Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,675
And I know I'll never get rich doing it,
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...

78
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,386
...knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

79
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,555
That is so great.

80
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,433
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,892
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,395
- Uh, we'd better call the fire department.
- No. No.

83
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,565
- No, no?
- Well, we don't need a fireman.

84
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,734
We need, like, a good mechanic.

85
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,238
Oh, my God. Here they come.
We gotta get out of here.

86
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,489
Wait. Why?

87
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,367
Look, if I wanted to see a fireman,
I would date one, okay?

88
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,122
That's all it is, a third nipple.

89
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,917
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.

90
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,629
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

91
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,924
Take your shirt off and let's see
what we're dealing with here.

92
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,304
What are you doing?

93
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,726
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

94
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,729
- Well, that's not a third nipple.
- Oh?

95
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,190
First of all, it's on your ass.

96
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,525
Well, then what is it?

97
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,944
Wait a minute. Hold it.

98
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,116
- Jansen, will you come in here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton.

99
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,619
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

100
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,457
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

101
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,795
You know what? If he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

102
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,882
Well, if he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should water his plants...

103
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,804
...if you know what I mean.

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,931
Or, ha, ha...

105
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,433
...we could go over there
and pee on them.

106
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,063
I can't take it, you know?

107
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,941
I'm always afraid one of them
is gonna catch me with the other.

108
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,651
It's making me crazy.

109
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,320
Well, honey, why don't you
break up with one of them?

110
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,658
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to playing the field?

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,993
Well, it doesn't feel
like playing anymore.

112
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,330
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

113
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,167
- So, Pheebs, pick one of them.
- Yeah, which one do you like more?

114
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,672
Well, Vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,968
You know?
He's just so burly, so very burly.

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,514
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with Vince.

117
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,516
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

118
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,019
- Well, sensitive is important. Pick him.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,981
Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

120
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,317
Jason is not a sissy.

121
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,695
Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.

122
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,709
You know, I have dinner plans.

123
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,213
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

124
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:49,468
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years...

125
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,262
...and I'm stumped.

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,775
Okay, this is the den.

127
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,487
All right, check this out. Lights.

128
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,073
Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.

129
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,201
Lights, go away.

130
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,205
Aw, see? You just need
to find the right command.

131
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,957
Yes. And the dimmer switch.

132
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,503
Whoa. For a rich guy,
that's a pretty small TV.

133
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,379
No, no, no. That's the videophone.

134
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:30,258
But hey, guys, you're not supposed
to be here, so please don't touch anything.

135
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,720
IKEA, this is comfortable.

136
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,973
This place is amazing.

137
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,809
- Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen.
- I know.

138
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,520
No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.

139
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,939
The refrigerator told me
to have a great day.

140
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,609
Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.

141
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,152
Joey, put that down.

142
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,948
Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.

143
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,284
- How the hell do you answer a videophone?
- Monica?

144
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,455
I guess that's how.

145
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,249
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

146
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,210
Oh, it's good. It's, um... It's good.

147
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,128
Just here, watering the plants.

148
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,464
Well, don't forget that ficus
over there by Rachel.

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,552
Ha. Chandler's on the couch.

150
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,306
Yeah, I see him. You guys
are just the worst hiders ever.

151
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,560
- Hi, Pete.
- How you doing?

152
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,311
Uh, Pete, um...

153
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,564
The other day when you said
you needed to talk...

154
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,317
...um, just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

155
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,820
Oh, it's good news.
No, it's definitely good news.

156
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,573
Hold on a second, I have another call.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,157
Hey, how's it going?

158
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,118
No, no, no, it's still me.

159
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,203
No, it's not.
I've got picture-in-picture here.

160
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,500
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

161
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,295
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

162
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,172
Oh. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll see you soon.

163
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,341
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you.

164
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,885
We love you too.

165
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,263
Okay.

166
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,682
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

167
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,060
- So, what do you think the good news is?
Look at this.

168
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,565
He wrote a check for $50,000
to Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.

169
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,861
Oh. Sorry. Uh, what do you think
the good news is?

170
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,656
Oh, my.

171
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,825
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire.

172
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,704
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone.
Call Mom. Call Mom.

173
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,706
Hello?

174
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,208
And that's Pete's mom. Ha, ha.

175
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,799
No, Mon, you have to make it
a theme wedding.

176
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,509
And the theme could be:

177
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,845
"Look How Much Money We've Got. "

178
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,224
You know? I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

179
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,353
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

180
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,563
And, uh, you could start
with a money salad.

181
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,400
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

182
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,902
Would you stop?

183
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,364
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.

184
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,116
Yes, but this is Pete, okay?
He's not like other people.

185
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,993
On your first date, he took you to Rome.

186
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,164
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

187
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,126
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

188
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,254
Monica's right. We're talking about
getting married here.

189
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,674
Okay? She can't just rush into this.

190
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,219
Oh, what do you know?
You married a lesbian.

191
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,519
All right. I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

192
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,854
Oh. So you're going with the teacher,
huh?

193
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,858
Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive, you know?

194
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,445
And in the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

195
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,700
...just, like, a really, really,
really nice body.

196
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,205
Jason. Definitely Jason.

197
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,624
- Wish me luck.
Good luck.

198
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,503
Oh, my God.

199
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,635
Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

200
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,852
Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?

201
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,145
Oh, sure.

202
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,604
- Vince.
Yo.

203
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,819
Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

204
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,113
So, what's up?

205
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,489
Um...

206
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,116
Wow.

207
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,744
This isn't gonna be easy. Um...

208
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,873
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

209
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,499
Uh-huh.

210
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,502
Good deal.

211
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,672
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

212
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,719
It's just that, uh, I thought
we had something pretty special here.

213
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,098
An you know, I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

214
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,769
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

215
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,981
- Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so...
- I'm sorry. I can't talk.

216
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,985
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

217
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,948
Wait. Wait. Wait.

218
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,205
I'm telling you, if you wanna take care
of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

219
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,043
Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs.
I don't wanna make it savory.

220
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,964
You know, when girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

221
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,300
...they tell their friends about it.

222
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,511
Give me that.

223
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,392
Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,727
Bride's magazines?

225
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,605
Yes, and I know that you said
you'd say no if he asked you...

226
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,942
...but I'm sorry, how great would you look
walking down the aisle...

227
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,236
...in this Donna Karan?

228
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,322
Oh, you so would.

229
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,115
Oh, you should get that anyway.

230
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,869
Well, for clubbing.

231
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,247
It is so weird.

232
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,583
I know what I said. But, um, this morning...

233
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,254
...I was lying in bed, I was imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

234
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,426
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

235
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,179
...and it's totally not like me
to do something like this.

236
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,432
But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?

237
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,393
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

238
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,145
And I know that we want
the same things.

239
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,815
And when I thought
about saying yes...

240
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,817
...it made me really happy.

241
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,777
Oh, my God.

242
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,989
I know.

243
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,866
I need more pie.

244
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,955
Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

245
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,960
You didn't break up with that fireman?

246
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,045
No, that was my way of telling you.

247
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,632
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

248
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,051
He keeps a journal and he paints.

249
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,429
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

250
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,638
Wow.

251
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,851
He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know,
he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

252
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,355
So then are you gonna dump Jason?

253
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,817
Well, yeah, because I have to break up
with someone and...

254
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,988
Okay, so Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is Vince.

255
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,574
Plus Vince has the body. You know?

256
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,159
So...

257
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,371
It's really just about the math.

258
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,173
- Jason.
Yeah, come on in.

259
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,058
Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious
on the phone.

260
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,226
Is, uh, anything wrong?

261
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,686
No.

262
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,163
You must be Ross.

263
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,376
- Hi.
- I am Guru Saj.

264
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,049
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so...

265
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,135
Well, relax. If it makes you
feel any better, I've attended...

266
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,639
...some of the finest medical schools
in Central America.

267
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,726
Well, then, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

268
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,812
Come on, have a seat.

269
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,231
Aha.

270
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,860
Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.

271
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,197
What's a "kundus"?

272
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,951
I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

273
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,832
Please lie down.

274
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,918
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

275
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,254
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

276
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,506
Oh, sure. We should see results...

277
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,426
Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.

278
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,512
What? What?

279
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,806
We appear to have angered it.

280
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,225
We? We angered it?

281
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,479
Oh. I think I see the problem.

282
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,608
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

283
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,778
Love.

284
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,072
Oh, God.

285
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:18,703
Ross, there is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off...

286
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,580
...unless you start to...
- Ow.

287
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,124
- Oops.
- What was that?

288
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,585
Well, it's gone.

289
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,712
How's that?

290
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,922
Got caught in my watch.

291
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,508
Hey, ha, ha.

292
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,721
Lights.

293
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,058
Uh, romantic lights.

294
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,977
Ooh, nice. Ha, ha.

295
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,564
So, uh, there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

296
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,610
Oh, right.
I completely forgot about that.

297
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,321
Well, uh...

298
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,656
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

299
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,784
And I look at my life...

300
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,494
Yeah?

301
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,997
- And I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

302
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,876
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

303
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,630
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

304
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,591
Wow.

305
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,385
But there's one thing missing.

306
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,930
What's that?

307
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,559
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

308
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,563
Okay.

309
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,401
Monica? I wanna become...

310
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,363
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

311
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,241
You wanna what?

312
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,285
I wanna become
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

313
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,080
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

314
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,957
It's banned in 49 states.

315
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,376
What are you talking about?

316
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,211
Okay, my trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

317
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,047
...a combination of Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian street-fighting.

318
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,592
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

319
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,679
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

320
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,389
Yeah.

321
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,810
Monica, I want you there
in the front row when I win.

322
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,479
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

323
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,150
What do you think?

324
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,653
My parents will be so happy.

325
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,828
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

326
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,500
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

327
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,336
Crazy underwear

328
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,091
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

329
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,177
All right, just keep playing,
just keep playing.

330
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,013
You'll get through this. You'll be fine.

331
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,858
Okay, thank you.

332
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:58,154
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

333
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,201
Hey.

334
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,703
I just was passing by
and saw you were playing.

335
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,538
This is kind of cool,
seeing you up there.

336
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,165
Well, hey.

337
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,125
Whoa, hey, hey.

338
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,377
What's going on here? Who's this guy?

339
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,049
I don't know. He just started
kissing me. Get him, Vince.

340
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,260
What?

341
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,722
Yeah, okay, I've been dating both of you.

342
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,310
And it's been really horrible,
because, you know, it's been...

343
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,729
...a lot of fun for me.

344
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,360
But I like you both...

345
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,987
...and I didn't know how to choose.

346
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,950
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.

347
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:47,620
Phoebe, Phoebe. Relax. It's okay.
I mean...

348
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,830
We never said this was exclusive.

349
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,084
Yeah, neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

350
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,044
Really?

351
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,339
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven't been going out that long.

352
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,051
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet. Ha, ha.

353
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,719
You haven't?

354
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,934
- You have?
- Okay, well, this is none of my business.

355
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,856
I can't believe this. You slept with him?

356
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,818
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

357
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,989
You know, Phoebe,
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

358
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,123
Well, that could've been really awkward.

359
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,129
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

360
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,133
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

361
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,552
You know, I can't believe
I went out with somebody...

362
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,597
...who'd actually have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area.

363
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,401
Everything's gonna be all right.

364
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,237
Okay, Dick?

365
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,783
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

366
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,744
Whoa.

367
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,456
He's supposed to be a duck, right?
Because otherwise...

368
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,000
...this is way out of my league.

369
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,838
Yeah, yeah. He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet, he can't do anything about it.

370
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,132
- Is there something you can do?
- Hmm.

371
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,887
Let me see.

372
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,682
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?
