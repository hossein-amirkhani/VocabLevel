1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,253
Hey.

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,506
Six dollars, please.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,217
Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,054
Eight o'clock is the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

5
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,434
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,646
Look, you're gonna have to help me
out here because I only have 3.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,857
I can help with that.

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,028
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,613
- Hi.
- Hi.

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,366
Wow. Your lip went bald.

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,578
Thanks.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,457
So you look great.

13
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,708
Yeah, right. Ha, ha.

14
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,002
No, you do. You...

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,421
- You just... You...
- What?

16
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,882
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,930
Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,224
...and static cling. Ha, ha.

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,810
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,687
...and saw an opportunity.

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,856
It's good to see you.

22
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,983
It's good to see you too.

23
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,705
- See that guy? He's in "Classics" now...
- Who?

24
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,251
...but you know as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

25
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,545
He's gonna go up to the counter
with Citizen Kane...

26
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,172
...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
- Ha, ha.

27
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,928
This is nice.

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,888
- Ha, ha. Yeah.
- I miss this.

29
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,431
Me too.

30
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,392
So you wanna get a hamburger
or something?

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,727
Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

32
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,730
No. Just friends. I won't grope you.
I promise.

33
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,567
Yeah, I think it's too soon.

34
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,528
No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.

35
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,992
Yeah, baby.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,453
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

37
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,164
No, thanks. I'm 29.

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.

39
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,003
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

40
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,921
I don't know, honey.
It could be really late.

41
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,673
Oh, come on. Not again.

42
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,718
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?

43
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,469
- Mm.
- Every night that you're asleep...

44
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,263
...before I get home from work...
- Yeah.

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,350
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,312
Well, now, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

47
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,688
Thank you.

48
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,607
- Hi.
Hey, Pheebs.

49
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,066
- Hi.
Hey.

50
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,694
Look at you.
Since when do you Rollerblade?

51
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,071
Oh. Since tomorrow.

52
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,282
I met this really cute guy in the park.

53
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,952
And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,831
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts ofjock stuff.

55
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,500
- And what are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna let him.

56
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,336
- Okay.
- Cool.

57
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,630
- Morning.
Hey.

58
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,049
- Somebody got in late last night.
Ahem.

59
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,384
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,139
- When did this happen?
- Oh, um, around 8:02.

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,017
And we, uh, talked for a little while...

62
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,811
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,564
Oh, there's no such thing
as an innocent burger.

64
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,484
Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

65
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,527
Monica, what are you doing?

66
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,988
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...

67
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,785
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

68
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,247
It's not a date, okay?

69
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,708
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

70
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,503
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,047
...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Mm.

72
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,175
We're not gonna have sex.

73
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,177
Okay? Nothing's changed here.

74
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,680
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.

75
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,765
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

76
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,642
Naked friends.

77
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,649
- Hey. Do you have any ice?
- Hey.

78
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,067
Check the freezer.

79
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,695
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

80
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,155
Are you just getting home from work?
It's late.

81
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,658
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

82
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,327
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.

83
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:51,540
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.

84
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,874
How was your day?

85
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,253
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth
using just my tongue.

86
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,381
Hmm.

87
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,841
Um...

88
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,553
Why do you have a copy of The Shining
in your freezer?

89
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,557
Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so...

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,228
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

91
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,605
Well, safer.

92
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,399
I never start reading The Shining...

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,152
...without making sure
we got plenty of room in the freezer.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,403
- You know?
- Ha, ha.

95
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,739
How often do you read it?

96
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,533
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

97
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,578
Well, um, I guess I read Little Women
more than once.

98
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,039
But that's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?

99
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,876
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about The Shining?"

100
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,922
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing. "
All right?

101
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,883
This is, like, the scariest book ever.

102
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,802
I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

103
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,096
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

104
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,432
Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,313
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

106
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,981
- All right, you got it.
- All right?

107
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,191
- Okay.
- Okay.

108
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,652
- Uh, now, Rach, these little women...
- Yeah.

109
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,238
How little are they?

110
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,408
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

111
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,959
- Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.
Oh, hey.

112
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,253
- Hi.
- You have lipstick right here.

113
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,130
- Oh.
- Huh. That's okay, it's mine.

114
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,840
We just kissed.

115
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,302
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

116
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,013
Well, I'm from California.

117
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,683
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

118
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,823
I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

119
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,908
Anybody, uh, want anything?

120
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,410
- I'll have coffee.
- Yeah, me too.

121
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,080
Yeah, make that three.
- Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?

122
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,167
Okay. Ha, ha.

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,504
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

124
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,673
Robert's coming out.

125
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,967
What do you mean? What, is he gay?

126
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,387
No, he...

127
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,434
He's coming out of his shorts.

128
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,688
What?

129
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,524
The man is showing brain.

130
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,489
Are you sure? Hold on.

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,201
Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

132
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,203
Coffee. We could write it down.
- Okay.

133
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,331
No, no. That won't be, uh...
Won't be necessary.

134
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,549
- Well?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,759
What do we do? What do we do?

136
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:55,140
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

137
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,560
Like an eclipse.

138
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,734
When people compliment me
on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

139
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,779
Well, you say, "Thank you very much. "
And then you buy me something pretty.

140
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,741
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

141
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,952
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

142
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,706
Ooh, this feels very weird.

143
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,959
Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day
and this feels weird?

144
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,253
Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.

145
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,131
But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

146
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,889
That's my hand.

147
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,891
Oh.

148
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,519
- Okay.
- Gotta keep squishing.

149
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,020
The tomatoes are squishing.

150
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,481
- Oh, yeah. Oh.
- Oh.

151
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,067
Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.

152
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,443
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second.

153
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:53,406
Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

154
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,825
It should, um, do...

155
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,745
...the trick.

156
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,256
What?

157
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,633
Um, you've got some on your pants.

158
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,472
I'll just throw them out.

159
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,313
These little women.

160
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,357
Wow.

161
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,609
You're liking it, huh?

162
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,321
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

163
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,657
I don't see how
he could ever forgive her.

164
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:41,871
Um, Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,208
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

166
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,837
Oh.

167
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,008
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

168
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,760
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

169
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,849
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

170
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,353
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

171
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,024
- Hey.
- Hey.

172
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,109
Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?

173
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:16,281
Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

174
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,949
You mean a 3-pointer?

175
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,619
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.

176
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,706
So, um, is there a phone here
I can check my messages?

177
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,044
- Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
- Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.

178
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,059
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

179
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,852
Hello.

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,525
- Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met.
Hi.

181
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,611
- Uh, good to meet you. Robert.
- Okay.

182
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,699
What?

183
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,703
What? You guys, what is going on?

184
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,664
Do you not like Robert?

185
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,124
Why are you laughing?

186
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,335
Calm down. No reason to get testy.

187
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,677
- You guys. Come on.
- We're sorry.

188
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:24,641
It just seems that Robert isn't
as concealed in the shorts area...

189
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,267
...as, uh, one may have hoped.

190
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,937
How do you mean?

191
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,398
Hey.
- Hey.

192
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:36,861
Uh, Robert? Could you, uh,
pass me those cookies?

193
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,697
Sure.

194
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,079
So how'd the lasagna go over?

195
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,667
Really? Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.

196
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,130
Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.

197
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,467
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

198
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,970
What...? It's a word.

199
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,561
Yeah. I do think it's better this way.
Yeah, we're being smart.

200
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,771
Yes, I'm sure.

201
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,942
You really sure?

202
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,486
I'll call you back.

203
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,916
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

204
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,462
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

205
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,964
Like racquetball.

206
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,593
Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.

207
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,347
So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...

208
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,810
...um, do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

209
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,937
Just your dad.

210
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,276
Although that's actually racquetball.

211
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,113
You know, I do have a blind date...

212
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,366
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

213
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,038
Do you want me to cancel it?

214
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,706
No.

215
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,084
- No.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:19,172
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

217
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,051
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

218
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,679
Hey.

219
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,723
Hey. Oh, don't sit down.

220
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,600
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- You bet.

221
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,894
And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.

222
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,939
Oh, wow.

223
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,567
- Hey.
- Stretchy pants?

224
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,903
Well, those are the greatest things
in the world.

225
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,614
If I were you, I'd wear them every day,
every day.

226
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,910
Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

227
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,456
But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

228
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,876
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

229
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,129
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,007
That's all right. I'll figure...

231
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,637
Hey.
- How you doing?

232
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,639
- How's it going?
- Good.

233
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,849
- Good.
Hey, Rach?

234
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,727
- How you doing with The Shining?
- Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.

235
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,606
Ooh. The next part's the best.
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

236
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,192
No, no, no. Come on.
You're gonna ruin it.

237
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,736
All right, I'll talk in code.

238
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,282
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

239
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,868
- Yeah, that's very cool.
Yeah.

240
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:34,622
Ooh. All blank and no blank
makes blank a blank-blank, right?

241
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,293
Oh, no, no. No, the end.

242
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,587
When Jack almost kills them all
with that blank...

243
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,423
...but then in the last second
they get away. Aw.

244
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,676
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

245
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,512
I can't believe she cracked your code.

246
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:58,187
All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no...

247
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,650
...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.

248
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,612
Hey.

249
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,156
Mine was by accident.

250
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,532
All right.

251
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,202
The boiler explodes and destroys
the hotel and kills the dad.

252
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,372
Beth dies.

253
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,884
Beth...? Beth dies?

254
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,093
Mm-hm.

255
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,097
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

256
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,768
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

257
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,228
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've just ruined...

258
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:42,774
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

259
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,572
No. She doesn't die.

260
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,616
Then why would you say that?

261
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:59,540
Because I wanted to hurt you.

262
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,962
Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

263
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,341
Got them.

264
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,389
Hi.

265
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,433
Sorry. I'm sorry.

266
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,727
You would not believe my day.

267
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,815
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

268
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,111
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

269
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,991
What are you smiling at?

270
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,451
Sorry, I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

271
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,084
Hello.

272
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,795
I love this friend thing.

273
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,804
Listen, Robert's gonna be here
any second...

274
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,015
...so could one of you just tell him?

275
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,683
- Oh.
Please, right now.

276
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,854
No, every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

277
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,690
We can't tell him.

278
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,901
You can't go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his...

279
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,320
...stuff.

280
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,324
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

281
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,663
- Hey.
Hey.

282
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,873
So you ready for the gym?

283
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,084
They've got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

284
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,505
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

285
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,135
What?

286
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,555
Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert...

287
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,684
- Hey, don't we have to?
- Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.

288
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,314
Um...

289
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,984
I think you're really, really great.

290
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,488
Oh, God. Here we go again.

291
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:58,201
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

292
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,082
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

293
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,880
I don't know what to say.

294
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,802
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

295
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,199
Ow.

296
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:43,538
Really? Well, it's just like
everyone else's apartment.

297
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,540
It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.

298
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,251
I just wanted to see
where you live. Now give me the tour.

299
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,503
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

300
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,880
Uh, this is the living room.
That's nice.

301
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,298
All right.

302
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,135
- And this is the kitchen.
That's real pretty.

303
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,178
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

304
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,391
The bedroom.
Well, it's pretty much your typical...

305
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,061
...bedroom.
- Oh, ha, ha.

306
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,480
- We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha.
- Mm-hm.

307
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,065
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.

308
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,778
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

309
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,506
So, um, who is she?

310
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,427
Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date
I told you about.

311
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,680
- She called and switched it from Tuesday.
- Aw.

312
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,641
Did you like her?

313
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:50,771
And I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

314
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,109
Well, you seem fine.

315
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,071
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

316
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,992
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

317
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,578
She wants to see your bedroom.

318
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,587
You know what?

319
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,133
What if we're friends...

320
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,719
...who don't see other people?

321
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,640
You mean like exclusive friends?

322
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,059
Why not?

323
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,146
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

324
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,566
Would it be so terrible?

325
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,488
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

326
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:47,161
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

327
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,748
...and vowed to be friends forever.

328
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,378
Wow.

329
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,507
You know, we're back where we were.

330
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:06,305
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

331
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,226
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

332
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,730
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

333
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,859
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

334
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,612
You know what?

335
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,865
I gotta walk out of here right now.

336
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,204
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

337
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,041
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

338
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,003
I know I couldn't.

339
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,047
Yeah.

340
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,051
So...

341
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,354
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

342
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,404
- Watch the thorns.
- Ow.

343
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,871
What?

344
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,249
Beth is really, really sick.

345
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,751
Oh.

346
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:24,800
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

347
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,680
- Joey?
- Yeah?

348
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,350
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

349
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,353
Okay.
