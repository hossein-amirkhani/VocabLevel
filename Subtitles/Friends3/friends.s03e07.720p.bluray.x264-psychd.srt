1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,296
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter
how famous their parents are...

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,924
...nobody is allowed
to climb on the dinosaur.

3
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,427
But of course,
this went right in one ear...

4
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,346
I love how he cares so much
about stuff.

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,475
If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,897
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,027
When are those gonna become extinct?

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,658
If I was a superhero
who could fly and be invisible...

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,077
...that would be the best.

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,293
What does Rachel see in this guy?

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,629
I love Rachel.

12
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,593
I wish she was my wife.

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,815
Who's singing?

14
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,995
Hey, when you guys were kids
and you played Happy Days...

15
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,874
...who were you? I was always Richie.
- I was always Joanie.

16
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,295
Question: Was, uh, "Egg the Gellers"
the war cry of your neighborhood?

17
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,049
Ew, ew! It's the Mattress King.

18
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,884
- Don't look. Change the channel.
Boo!

19
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,679
Wait. I want to see this.
After I divorce him...

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,974
...half of that kingdom
is gonna be mine.

21
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,227
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,313
My kingdom is suddenly
without a queen.

23
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,065
I'm so depressed...

24
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,817
...I'm going to slash...

25
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,111
...my prices! Check it out!

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,365
599 for a California king.
499 for a pillow-top queen set.

27
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,826
I'm going medieval on prices.

28
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,870
What a wank.

29
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:47,082
Oh, I cannot believe he's using
our divorce to sell mattresses.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,420
I know. At 499 for a pillow-top queen,
who cares about the divorce?

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,922
Those babies will sell themselves.

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,886
And I'm appalled for you, by the way.

33
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,432
I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.

34
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:12,316
Okay. Okay, Daddy. We'll see you
tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,277
- "We"?
- Ahem.

36
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,948
- Are, uh, having dinner with my dad
tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

37
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,409
Oh, shoot. Tomorrow's not good.

38
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,078
I'm supposed to, um, fall off
the Empire State Building...

39
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,623
...and land on a bicycle
with no seat, so...

40
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,419
Ross, my father doesn't hate you.

41
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,631
Please. He refers to me as "Wet-Head. "

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,259
Honey, he calls everybody
by a nickname.

43
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,721
Okay, look, I know. Just one dinner.
Please, one night. For me. Please?

44
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,724
I just want him to love you like I do.

45
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,852
All right. Well, not exactly like I do.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,688
But if you do come to dinner...

47
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,234
...I'll love you like I do
in that black thing that you like.

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,361
I'll go.

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,492
- Fine.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,497
Hi, Gunther.

51
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,707
Yeah. We'll see.

52
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,336
- Hey, you guys.
Hey.

53
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,088
Hey. Hey.
- Guess what.

54
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,881
- I got a gig.
- Great.

55
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,593
See, that's why I can never be an actor.
Because I can't say "gig. "

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,013
Yeah, I can't say "croissant. "
Oh, my God.

57
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,809
- What's the part?
- It's not a part. No.

58
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,979
I'm teaching Acting for Soap Operas
at the Learning Extension.

59
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,397
Come on. That's great.

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,149
It's like my chance
to give something back...

61
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,485
...to the acting community.

62
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,905
You know, you're probably not allowed
to sleep with any of your students.

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,537
I know.

64
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,795
Ugh. I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.

65
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,756
I mean, if you buy a bed
from Janice's ex-husband...

66
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,675
...that's like betraying Chandler.

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,052
Not at these prices.

68
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,183
Hi.

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,104
You know, in England this car would be
on the other side of the store.

70
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,527
Whoosh.

71
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,406
Oh, oh, oh.

72
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,825
Phoebe, come here.

73
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,952
Ah, this is my new bed.

74
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,913
You gotta feel this bad boy.

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,208
Ugh. Monica, it still feels so weird,
you know?

76
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,877
Chandler's your friend. Oh.

77
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,588
Oh, my God.

78
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:45,385
Oh. All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends. Oh.

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,103
Good evening.

80
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,773
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

81
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,777
And I will be teaching
Acting for Soap Operas.

82
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,820
Now, um...

83
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:09,409
...on my first day as Dr. Drake
Ramoray on Days of our Lives...

84
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,332
...uh, ahem, I learned that
one of the most important things...

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,502
...in soap opera acting is reacting.

86
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,380
This does not mean acting again.

87
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,051
It means you don't have a line,
but someone else just did.

88
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,595
And it goes something like this. Ahem.

89
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,020
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,023
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas...

91
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,235
...some of you are gonna have to become
much more attractive.

92
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,154
All right, moving right along...

93
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,868
- Hi.
- Hey.

94
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,664
- Oh! How was teaching last night?
- Oh, it was great. You get to say stuff like:

95
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:00,419
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you. "

96
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,296
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,799
Oh, and guess what.
I got an audition for All My Children.

98
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,968
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah, it's this great part.

99
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,678
This boxer named Nick.

100
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,597
And I'm so, so right for it, you know?
He's just like me...

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,599
...except that he's a boxer...

102
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,393
...and has an evil twin.

103
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,271
Oh.

104
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,275
Dum-datta-dum.

105
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,695
Hear ye, hear ye.
Delivery from the Mattress King.

106
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,740
You Miss Geller?

107
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,076
- Okay.
- Sign here.

108
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,037
- Ooh. Do I have a middle name?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,374
All right. Monica Felula...

110
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,293
...Geller.

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,462
It's that bedroom there.

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,217
Hey, Monica bought a bed
from the Mattress King?

113
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,721
Yeah. So please, please, please
don't say anything to Chandler.

114
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,682
- You want me to lie to Chandler?
- Is that a problem?

115
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,392
No.

116
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,146
Oh, hey, hey, Nick the boxer.
Let's see what you got.

117
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,064
- Yeah.
- All right, put them up. Come on.

118
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,650
- Hey, you're pretty good at this.
- Ha, ha.

119
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,944
Yeah, I had to learn.
I was staying at the Y...

120
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,739
...and some of the young men
weren't acting Christian enough.

121
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,203
Hey, now. Hey.

122
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,331
- Ow. And I'm bleeding. Okay, great.
- Oh, oh!

123
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,083
Wow. And I'm a vegetarian.

124
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,712
All right, I'm sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.

125
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,964
- Put your head back. Ooh.
- Okay. All right.

126
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,758
- I can't see.
- I have you.

127
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,051
Oh, God.

128
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,888
Which bedroom
do you want it in, Ms. Geller?

129
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,308
Oh. It's the compulsively neat one
by the window, okay?

130
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,101
Gotcha.

131
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,693
Hi, Daddy.

132
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,654
This is where they put us?

133
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,782
What? There was no table
available in the kitchen?

134
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,618
- Hello, baby.
- You remember Ross.

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,787
- Mm-hm.
- Nice to see you again, Dr. Green.

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,122
So.

137
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,005
- How's the library?
- Uh, museum.

138
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,343
- What happened to the library?
- There never was a library.

139
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,137
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just that I, um...

140
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,807
I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.

141
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,603
You know what's really good here?

142
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,146
- The lobster.
- Mm.

143
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:29,568
- What do you say? Shall I just order three?
- Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.

144
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,116
It was a joke. I made a joke.

145
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,245
Yeah, actually, Daddy,
Ross is allergic to lobster.

146
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,080
What kind of person's
allergic to lobster?

147
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,000
I guess the kind of person
that works in a library. Ha, ha.

148
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,835
- It's not...
- I know. It's a museum.

149
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,671
What, you're the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.

150
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,840
Uh, waiter.

151
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,968
We will have two lobsters and a menu.

152
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,641
So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?

153
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,685
They found rust.

154
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,814
- Do you know what rust does to a boat?
- Gives it a nice antique-y look?

155
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,448
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

156
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,074
Wow, I'm sorry.

157
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,577
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Ha, ha.

158
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,376
Excuse me for a moment,
will you, please?

159
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,879
I wanna say good night
to the Levines before we go.

160
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,714
Okay.

161
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,886
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

162
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,013
Yeah. Oh.

163
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,724
Uh-oh. I think your dad
must have added wrong.

164
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,559
He only tipped, like, 4 percent.

165
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,561
Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.

166
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,316
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it
bother you? You're a waitress.

167
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,109
Yes, it bothers me, Ross.

168
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,570
But, you know, if he was a regular
at the coffee house...

169
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,405
...I'd be serving him sneezers.

170
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,158
- So?
- So, Ross...

171
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,329
...I've bugged him about this
a million times. He's not gonna change.

172
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,873
Do you really serve people sneezers?

173
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,668
Ahem, well, um, I don't.

174
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,671
- All right, kids. Ready?
- Yes.

175
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,632
- Thanks again, Dr. Green.
- Uh-huh.

176
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,181
Wait, wait, wait,
I think I forgot my receipt.

177
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,225
- Oh, you don't need that.
- Ahem, why not?

178
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,562
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,
gets on your fingers and causes...

179
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,272
...the, uh, night blindness.

180
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,277
What is this?

181
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,321
Who put a 20 down here?

182
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,740
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah, that would be me.

183
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,951
Um, I have... I have a problem.

184
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,286
I tip way too much, way, way too much.

185
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,539
- It's a sickness, really.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

186
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,792
- We have to do something about that.
- Excuse me.

187
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,044
You think I'm cheap?

188
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,505
- He didn't mean anything by that.
- Huh?

189
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,426
- He really didn't.
- Nothing I do means anything. Really.

190
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,930
This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.

191
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,434
You put down 20 and you come out
looking like Mr. Big-Shot.

192
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,352
- You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot?
- Oh.

193
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,399
Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the
whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?

194
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,613
Well, "Mr. Big-Shot"
is better than "Wet-Head. "

195
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,325
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

196
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,828
Now, I've never been able to cry
as an actor...

197
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,581
...so if I'm in a scene
where I have to cry...

198
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,666
...I cut a hole in my pocket...

199
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,043
...take a pair of tweezers...

200
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,337
...and just start pulling.

201
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,010
Okay. Or uh...
Or let's say I want to convey...

202
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,096
...that I've, uh,
just done something evil.

203
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,267
Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a
fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.

204
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:57,025
No? Okay.
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

205
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:02,363
Well, all I do there
is try and divide 232 by 13.

206
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,791
And that's how it's done.

207
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,335
Great soap opera acting
tonight, everybody.

208
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,253
Class dismissed.

209
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,965
- Hey, Mr. Trib.
- Hey.

210
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,176
Guess what. I got an audition.

211
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,805
Oh. One of my students got an audition.
I'm so proud.

212
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,892
I was wondering if you would consider
coaching me for it.

213
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,895
- Oh, you bet. What's the part?
- Oh, it's great.

214
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,898
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.

215
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,909
Had to do it, didn't you?
You couldn't leave it alone.

216
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,580
Four percent, okay? I tip more than that
when there's a bug in my food.

217
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,625
Ross, tonight was about the two of you
getting along.

218
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,918
Ugh.

219
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,628
Would you see
my chiropractor already?

220
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,882
Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went
to medical school in a mini-mall.

221
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,222
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

222
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,225
I'm... I'm freaking out.

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:18,147
Monica kind of trusted me with something
and she shouldn't have.

224
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,276
All right, I haven't lived here in a while,
so I have to ask you.

225
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,820
Does Monica still turn the lights on
in her bedroom?

226
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,907
- Ahem. Yeah.
- I am so dead.

227
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,453
All right, look,
here's the bottom line, Ross.

228
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,164
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

229
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,126
So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow
and you can make nice.

230
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,546
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.

231
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,882
Okay. Look,
I realize my father is difficult...

232
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,677
...but that's why you have got to be
the bigger man here.

233
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,556
Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.

234
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,435
I could be a big, huge, giant man
and it still wouldn't make a difference.

235
00:14:55,644 --> 00:15:00,023
Except that I could pick your father up
and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor. "

236
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,320
Okay, well, can't you just try it
one more time, Ross? For me? For me?

237
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,114
Rachel, one brunch
is not gonna solve anything.

238
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,575
You've gotta face it.
We're never gonna get along.

239
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,994
Okay, well, you are just going to have to.

240
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,748
Okay? I've already got a mother and father
who cannot stay in the same room.

241
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,917
I don't want to have
a separate room for you too.

242
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,169
Okay, okay. Okay.

243
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,671
I'll get the bagels.

244
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,261
What's this?

245
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,015
Isn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom.

246
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,726
This is not the bed I ordered.

247
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,688
I know. You must have won,
like, a contest or something.

248
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,733
Phoebe.

249
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,277
Why is this car in my bedroom?

250
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,529
I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't looking...

251
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,741
...and the store said that they won't
take it back because you signed for it.

252
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,702
- When did I sign for it?
- When I was you.

253
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,539
You know what? It's all Joey's fault
because he left his nose open.

254
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,751
Did you make brownies today?

255
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,504
Knock, knock.

256
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,674
Quick. Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.

257
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,719
Hey, I'm going for sushi.
Does anybody want, uh...?

258
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,599
Whoa. Somebody missed the off-ramp.

259
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,521
It's Monica's bed. What?

260
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,398
Okay...

261
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,234
It's a race car.

262
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,113
So? This has always been Monica's bed.
What, you're just noticing now?

263
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,906
How self-involved are you?

264
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,660
Okay, well, if this bed isn't new...

265
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,371
...then how come there's plastic
on the mattress?

266
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,458
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

267
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,006
Look...

268
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,719
...I just saw my best friend's brain
smeared across the canvas.

269
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,512
It's not gonna be me.

270
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,472
Not me.

271
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,225
Wow.

272
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,812
That was good. That was...

273
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,481
- Tweezers?
- No.

274
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,774
Oh, wow.

275
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,945
- That was really good.
- Thanks.

276
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,697
Any suggestions?

277
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,158
Hmm, I...

278
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,331
You told him to play the boxer gay?

279
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:30,298
Well, I might have said "super-gay. "

280
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,259
You totally screwed him over.

281
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,471
Joey, you're this guy's teacher.
I mean, how could you do this?

282
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,723
Because, Monica, the guy's so good.

283
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,184
And I really, really want this part.

284
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,353
Well, if you really, really want it,
then it's okay.

285
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,566
- Hi, Daddy.
- Baby.

286
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:54,072
- Ross?
- Dr. Green, how are you?

287
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,409
Thanks for dinner last night.

288
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,204
Thank you for teaching me
a valuable lesson.

289
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,956
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

290
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,088
Okay, that's it. I can't take it anymore.

291
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,798
What, what? He's interested in you.

292
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,384
- He just wants to know how you got here.
- Oh, please.

293
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,180
- Sweetie, it's hopeless. I'm just gonna go.
- What? Ross.

294
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,349
- I'm sorry. It's just...
Ross?

295
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,101
What's with the neck?

296
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,145
He's got this thing and I keep
telling him to go to my chiropractor.

297
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,231
You still going to that chiropractor?

298
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,775
That man couldn't get into med school
in Ixtapa.

299
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,237
Yeah, thank you.
That's what I keep saying.

300
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,199
Excuse me, ahem, Dr. Bobby happens
to be an excellent doctor.

301
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,577
Wait a minute. His name is Dr. Bobby?

302
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,081
- Well, that's his last name.
- And his first name.

303
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,542
He's Bobby Bobby?

304
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,795
Ahem. It's Robert Bobby.

305
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,213
Oh.

306
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,966
And, um, excuse me. He helps me.

307
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,344
- Oh. Please. Ask her how?
- What do you need help for?

308
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,805
With my alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.

309
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,224
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Argue with that.

310
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,601
What? It's true.
My right leg is two inches shorter.

311
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,979
Come on, you're just tilting.

312
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,190
- Her legs are fine.
- I know that.

313
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,235
- So why do you let her go to a chiropractor?
- I'm sorry, "Let her"?

314
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,947
What can I do? She doesn't listen to me
about renter's insurance, either.

315
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,992
Wait a minute.
You don't have renter's insurance?

316
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,079
- No. Ahem.
- So, what if somebody steals something?

317
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,917
How you gonna run after him
with one leg shorter than the other?

318
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,383
Hey, would you, uh...?
Would you like some juice?

319
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,969
- I'd love some juice.
- Okay.

320
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,140
Well, this is going so well.
Did you see us? Did you see?

321
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,893
Yeah, honey. I was standing right there.

322
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,770
Why don't you tell him about the mole
I haven't gotten checked?

323
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,272
Excellent.

324
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,237
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

325
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,491
...when you'll have a chance to screw over
another soap opera actor.

326
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,954
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

327
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,459
And I'm ashamed to say...

328
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,252
...that I took it.

329
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,633
I advised a fellow actor to play a role...

330
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,552
...homosexually.

331
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,973
Yeah.

332
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,560
We both auditioned for the part and, uh...

333
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,980
...as it turned out...

334
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,399
...they...

335
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,029
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

336
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,991
And now...

337
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,078
...he's got a two-year contract...

338
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,581
...opposite Susan Lucci...

339
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,918
...the first lady of daytime television.

340
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,170
And me?

341
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,466
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

342
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,970
...most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

343
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,933
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

344
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,319
Thank you.

345
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,200
- Uh, may I help you?
- Yes, hi.

346
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,786
I'm the lady who got stuck
with the race-car bed.

347
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,374
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

348
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,837
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller. "

349
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,715
All right, jester man, look,
we wanna see the king.

350
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,842
Nobody sees the king.

351
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,928
Okay. I'm talking to the king.

352
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,097
Hey, you can't go back there.

353
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,732
Oh, my God.

354
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,706
Hey, watch it, lady.

355
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,922
Hey, good-looking.

356
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,559
All right, I'll leave.

357
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,978
My bed's so boring.
