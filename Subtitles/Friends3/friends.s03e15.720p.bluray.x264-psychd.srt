1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:07,464
Hey, how much you give me to eat
this whole jar of olives?

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:10,968
I won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me 2.95.

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,178
Done.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,807
Hi. I need an atlas. I need an atlas.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,101
Why? Do you have a report due?

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,229
I have a date with this diplomat I met...

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,274
...while I was giving free massages
outside the U.N.

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,694
And I don't know where his country is.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,988
Okay, let's start with the free massages
at the U.N.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,992
Oh, it's my new thing.
I figure, bodies at peace make peace.

11
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,955
Wow. You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

12
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,666
- So, what country is this guy from?
- Um...

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,006
There's a G in there.

14
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,301
- Where's that?
- In your atlas.

15
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,470
- I don't have an atlas.
- Oh.

16
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,347
- Oh, but wait, I do have a globe. Hold on.
- Oh.

17
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,933
- So, Pheebs, what's this guy like?
- Um...

18
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,977
Well, he's very...

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,645
...dashing, you know?

20
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,815
And, um, very, very sophisticated.
And he doesn't speak English...

21
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,860
...but according to his translator,
he totally gets me.

22
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,696
Okay, here you go.

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,656
What is this?

24
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,868
It's a globe.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,412
And a pencil sharpener.

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,375
Hey, anybody need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.

27
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,668
Uh, no, thanks.

28
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,755
Okay, listen, just give me anything
I can make two of.

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,966
If you don't have anything to copy,
why are you going there?

30
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,594
Yeah, are you just going down there
to gawk at that hot girl...

31
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,513
...with the bellybutton ring again?

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,972
Yeah. You wanna come?

33
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,892
Yeah.

34
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,446
Come on, Chloe.
Finish up with your customer first.

35
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,491
Come on, Chloe. Come on, Chloe.

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,868
Can I help you?

37
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,162
Uh-oh.

38
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,454
Uh, you know what?

39
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,499
We're having second thoughts
about our, uh, copying needs.

40
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,419
And, uh, we'll need a little more time
to think about it.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,756
Chloe, switch with me. There are
some guys here who got a crush on you.

42
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,427
Okay, that hurt us.

43
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,139
Hi, guys. I haven't seen you
since this morning.

44
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,433
Well, uh...

45
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,936
You know.

46
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,481
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

47
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,358
Both of us?

48
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,028
Maybe. Does that scare you?

49
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,869
Relax. It's just Isaac's deejaying
at The Philly.

50
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,996
- You should come.
- Oh. We'll be there.

51
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,457
Great. I'll, uh, see you then.

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,334
All right. Rock on.

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:48,143
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

54
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,897
Aw. Me too. Although this city is my home.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,317
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.

56
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,903
Um, just... You make something up.

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,321
Ahem. Uh...

58
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,040
Nice. Thank you.

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,334
This is me. Here.

60
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,138
Your eyes are very pretty.

61
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,350
Thank you very much.

62
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,559
Oh, thank you.

63
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,862
He would like to kiss you.

64
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,702
Okay. You know what?
You don't have to do that now.

65
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,454
No, no, not him. No, you don't.

66
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,378
Okay. Well, the moment's over.

67
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,430
Oh.

68
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,098
Oy.

69
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,228
See, there it is right there.

70
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,230
Wow, it's small.

71
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,734
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks...

72
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,819
...to get all the way across it.

73
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,821
So you had fun, huh?

74
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,283
Yeah. Except for, you know,
when you're on a date...

75
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,410
...and you're getting along really great...

76
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,288
...but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

77
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,040
No.

78
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,959
- Hey.
Hey.

79
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,627
What, is, uh, Rach in her room?

80
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,505
Oh. No, she's still at work,
but she told me to tell you to call her.

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,967
Oh, what? Is she gonna cancel
on me again? How could she do this?

82
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,677
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

83
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,639
All right, uh, Ross, this is the extent
of my knowledge on the subject.

84
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,932
"Call Rachel. "

85
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,435
What's that on the bottom?

86
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,481
Oh. That's my doodle
of a ladybug with a top hat. Ha, ha.

87
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,774
She's fancy.

88
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,654
- Hello?
Hey, honey.

89
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,782
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. What's going on?

90
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,202
Well, there was a disaster in shipping
and I've gotta get this order in.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,789
Honey, I'm so sorry,
but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.

92
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,750
What?
Well, um, how about I come up there?

93
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,796
No, no, no, honey, please.
I just have too much to deal with.

94
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,341
Anyway, I'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and, um...

95
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,510
Could you come
and be the translator's date?

96
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,806
So that when we... You know, it's time
for our alone time, you two can split off?

97
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,850
You know, he's kind of cute.

98
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,019
"Kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?

99
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,272
Or "kind of cute" like your friend
Spackle-Back Larry?

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,274
Hey, don't call him that.

101
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,777
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

102
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,741
Hey, you know what?
Maybe we should get going.

103
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,660
I mean, what time did Chloe say
to get there?

104
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,995
- Uh, 10:30.
- What time is it now?

105
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,997
Four-thirty.

106
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,042
- Yeah, all right. So we'll hang out.
- Yeah.

107
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,842
Hey, remember when she brought up
that thing about the three of us?

108
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,428
Yes, vividly.

109
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,640
- She was kidding about that, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

110
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,938
Yeah, I think so.

111
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,234
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight, huh?

112
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:28,071
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, uh...

113
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,740
...what would we do?

114
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,370
Ha, ha. Dude, I don't know. Ha-ha-ha.

115
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,456
- She was kidding.
- Yeah.

116
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,040
She was...

117
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,252
Just in case, we should come up
with a set of ground rules.

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,837
Yeah. For sure.

119
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,465
Okay. You probably
want the first one to be:

120
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,425
"Never open your eyes. "

121
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,221
You know? Because you don't
want to be doing something...

122
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,349
...and then look up, right?

123
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,895
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

124
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,688
Yeah. Good call. Nice.

125
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,107
Hold it. Hold it.

126
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,570
What if my eyes are closed, and...

127
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,072
And my hand is out there...

128
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,326
Aah! Okay, eyes open at all times.

129
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,206
Oh, hey.

130
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:23,168
How do we decide where we, ahem...

131
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,795
...you know, each would, ahem,
you know...

132
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,715
...be?
- Right. Right.

133
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,259
Well, you know, we could flip for it.

134
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,471
I guess. But, like, what's heads
and what's tails?

135
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,352
Well, if you don't know that,
then I don't want to do this with you.

136
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,942
No, no, no. I am looking
at a purchase order right here...

137
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,819
...and it clearly states
that we ordered the Riviera bikini...

138
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,698
...in a variety of sizes and colors and...

139
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,910
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

140
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,789
Could I please speak to your supervisor?
Thank you. We're holding.

141
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,290
- Hi.
- Oh!

142
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,917
My God. What are you doing here?

143
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,920
Well, you said
you couldn't go out, so...

144
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,298
You brought a picnic.
Ugh. What a boyfriend.

145
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,677
That's it. On Monday,
I start wearing makeup.

146
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,556
Ross, honey, this is very nice,
but I've got a crisis.

147
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,224
Yeah, but I've got couscous.

148
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,478
Honey. Honey, I'm sorry.
I know it's our anniversary...

149
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,898
...but I told you on the phone
I don't have time to stop.

150
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,652
Okay, you don't have to stop.
I'm invisible. I'm not here.

151
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,445
Yeah, but I don't...

152
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,073
Who approved that order?

153
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,410
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

154
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,913
- Get me Mark on the phone.
- Ugh. I love Mark. Do you know Mark?

155
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,001
- Yeah.
- Let me check that with what I've got here.

156
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,671
All right, see, 038 is not the number
for this store. Zero-three-eight is Atlanta.

157
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,011
Heh. Pepper?

158
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,141
- None for me.
- Okay, sorry. Whoo.

159
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,520
I'm sorry. As I was saying,
the store number is wrong.

160
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,981
And I'm sorry, but... Oh, my God!

161
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,695
Okay. It's fine.

162
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,405
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

163
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,866
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

164
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,200
I've got Shemp in my office.

165
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,539
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

166
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,958
But, um, hey, oh,
somebody's off the phone.

167
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,296
How about a glass of wine by the fire?
I can get it going again...

168
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,050
Ross, you're not listening.
I don't have time to stop.

169
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,136
- Come on, you don't have 10 minutes?
- I don't have 10 minutes.

170
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,015
- Sophie, does she have 10 minutes?
- Hey, Ross. I told you, I don't.

171
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,644
Don't yell at me, okay?
This is the most I've seen you all week.

172
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,106
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay?
I've got a deadline.

173
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,233
Would you just go home?
I'll talk to you later.

174
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,402
- Yeah, but wait...
- Goodbye.

175
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,245
Uh, actually, that's our three-hole punch.

176
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,629
- Hey.
- Hi.

177
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,839
Look, um, about what happened earlier...

178
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,927
Whoa. I completely understand.
You were stressed.

179
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,433
I was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

180
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,645
For what? For letting you
throw me out of your office?

181
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,981
You had no right
coming down to my office, Ross.

182
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,944
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work...

183
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,029
...unless maybe they were a park ranger.

184
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,160
Yeah, well, excuse me for wanting
to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

185
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,745
Boy, what an ass am I.

186
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,958
But I told you I didn't have the time.

187
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,793
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

188
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,587
I mean, I don't feel like
I have a girlfriend anymore.

189
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,423
Ross, what do you want from me?

190
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,467
You want me to quit my job so
you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

191
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:03,221
No. But it would nice if you'd realize
that it's just a job.

192
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,516
Just a job?

193
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,726
Yes.

194
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,147
Ross, do you realize this is the first time
in my life I'm doing something I care about?

195
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,442
This is the first time in my life
I'm doing something I'm actually good at?

196
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,943
I mean, if you don't get that...

197
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,654
No, hey, I get that. Okay?
I get that and I'm happy for you.

198
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,323
I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

199
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,744
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

200
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,955
Is this about Mark?

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,709
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

202
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,335
Oh, my God.

203
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,839
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

204
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,633
No, you're making this too hard.

205
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,969
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

206
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,596
I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,140
Look, ugh, maybe we should
just take a break.

208
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,100
Okay, okay. Fine. You're right.

209
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,811
Let's, uh... Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

210
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,981
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

211
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,026
No.

212
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,697
A break from us.

213
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,755
- And the advances in collating
in the past five years.

214
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,633
I mean, we just got in an X-5000,
you know?

215
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,552
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-71.

216
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,016
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy.

217
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,311
- Hi, Ross.
- Oh, hi, Chloe.

218
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,022
I want you to meet some friends of mine.

219
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,151
This guy's my hero.
He comes in with some stuff...

220
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,945
...he wants it blown up 400 percent.

221
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,239
We say we don't do that.
He says, "You gotta. "

222
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,449
And you know what? We did it.

223
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,370
And now any time anybody wants 400,
we just say, "Let's Ross it. "

224
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,373
And that's the only color that comes in.

225
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,044
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

226
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,966
So, what are you doing here?

227
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,176
I thought tonight was
your big anniversary dinner.

228
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,761
Yeah, a little change of plans.

229
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,597
Uh, we're gonna break up instead.

230
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,519
Oh, and I can also speak a little French.

231
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,192
Why? What did I say?

232
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,779
Well, you just asked if I wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

233
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,366
- Oh, my God.
Heh.

234
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,035
No wonder I get such great service
at Café Maurice.

235
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,872
Knock, knock, knock.

236
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:39,085
Hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei
that, um, I was fascinated...

237
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,088
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said in the New York Times?

238
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,511
You didn't say,
"Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "

239
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,722
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

240
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,225
He says he was too.

241
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,311
Interesting.

242
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,772
Uh, so I was wondering...

243
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,816
Before you get all talky again...

244
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,486
...um, could you also please
tell Sergei...

245
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,282
...that I really like his suit.

246
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,757
Uh, he said, "Thank you very much.
You look very pretty tonight.

247
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,343
Your hair, golden like the sun. "
So you're a chef?

248
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,221
I'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

249
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,890
- Oh, really?
- Monica...

250
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,017
...could I talk to you behind my menu,
please?

251
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,398
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was having a conversation.

252
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,275
Yeah, but Mischa's
so interested in you...

253
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,236
...that Sergei and I haven't been able
to say two words to each other.

254
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,990
What do you want me to do? Sit here
while the three of you have a conversation?

255
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,867
That would be great. Thank you.

256
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,336
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. It's Mark.

257
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,756
- Oh.
- What? Is it my breath?

258
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,677
No. Sorry. I just thought
you were somebody else. Hi.

259
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,680
Hi, well, look, I was just gonna
leave a message.

260
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,515
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

261
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,559
Well, um...

262
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,436
Rach? Are you okay?

263
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,772
Yeah, I'm fine.

264
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,358
You wanna talk? I mean, I can come over.

265
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,236
No, really, no. Please. That's okay.

266
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,655
All right. I'm coming over
and I'm bringing Chinese food.

267
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,282
- Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry.
- It's for me.

268
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,617
Oh.

269
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,412
Okay. Bye.

270
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,834
- So, what'll you do?
- What can I do?

271
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,336
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

272
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,257
Hey, no way. Come on, this is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

273
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,635
Come on. We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait a while?

274
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:57,223
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat.
Pick up your phone.

275
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,980
You know that whole swimming thing
is a myth.

276
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,691
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

277
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,985
Why? What happened to him?

278
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,280
Nothing. He just really believes in that.

279
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,118
Ugh. And then we got into this
big, stupid fight... It was awful.

280
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:21,914
I told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something, ugh...

281
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,417
And then...

282
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,837
...I told him I wanted to take a break.

283
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,214
I don't want to take a break.

284
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,425
Well, I'm sorry.

285
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,512
- Egg roll?
- No.

286
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:40,433
And then I called him,
and he wasn't there.

287
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,268
He's probably just out.

288
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,480
Oh, thank you. That's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.

289
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,612
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

290
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,491
- Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you called.
- Really?

291
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,994
I've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?

292
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,705
Hey, what do you want to drink?

293
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,040
Who's that?

294
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,126
Nobody?

295
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,338
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?

296
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,090
Is that Mark?

297
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,053
- Ooh, honey, look, he just came over...
- Yeah, got it.

298
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,103
Hey, Dinosaur Guy. Look at you, so sad.

299
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,022
- Come dance.
- Uh, that's okay. Thanks.

300
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,565
Hey.

301
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,527
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

302
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,780
Look, I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?

303
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,533
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.

304
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,703
And the vet said it was time.

305
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,705
And so from half-a-world away...

306
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,917
...while my mother
held the phone to his ear...

307
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,129
...I said goodbye to my dog...

308
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,339
...in seven languages.

309
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,593
- Could I have a tissue?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

310
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,805
I just hope you don't accidentally
suck it up through your nose...

311
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,640
...and choke on it.

312
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:12,358
Ugh. Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

313
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,112
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted. "

314
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:23,411
He's unbelievable. For the first time in
three years, someone wants to talk to me.

315
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,998
But do you think he would let me
enjoy that? No.

316
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,210
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English, Sergei?

317
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,883
Excuse me, but, um, ahem,
isn't he paying for your dinner?

318
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,051
Hey, the man's dog just died.

319
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,447
I have just resigned my post.

320
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,866
Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room?

321
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,784
I have diplomatic coupons.

322
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,539
It would be my pleasure.

323
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,417
My guy has coupons.

324
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,047
Your guy can't even say "coupons. "

325
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,178
Uh...

326
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,096
Uh, plate.

327
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,766
- Plate. Yes. Plate. Plate.
- Plate. Plate.

328
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,643
Plate.

329
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,104
See, we don't need them.

330
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,192
Plate?

331
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,902
Yeah.

332
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,491
Sleight of hand
And twist of fate

333
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,119
On a bed of nails
She makes me wait

334
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,038
I like this song.

335
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,166
Well, you're practically dancing already.

336
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,337
- Why don't you just do it over here?
- Oh, no.

337
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,714
- What are you, married?
- Ha, ha.

338
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,841
Because that's okay.

339
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,609
Oh, be home, be home, be home...

340
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,321
Be home, be home, be home.

341
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,534
You're not home.

342
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,752
With or without you

343
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,838
Still no smile?

344
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:54,687
And you give yourself away

345
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,150
And you give

346
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,778
And you give yourself away

347
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,377
American.

348
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,421
- American.
- American.

349
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,507
American. You know,
it's a very hard language.

350
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,676
Let's do it again.
