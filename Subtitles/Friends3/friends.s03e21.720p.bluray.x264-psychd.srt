1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:05,713
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,924
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,301
- Oh, my God. They took my idea.
- That was you?

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,678
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,680
Okay, there you go.

6
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,057
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

7
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,809
Oh, that's so... Aah!

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,936
Ow!

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,647
- Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?
- You all right?

10
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,818
Oh, my.

11
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,748
Hey.

12
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,292
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

13
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,090
Oh, so that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

14
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,344
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,805
Okay? You should come out
with Ross and me.

16
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,475
I mean, anything is better than sitting
around here crying all day about Kate.

17
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,811
Hey, I was crying because...

18
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,397
Because nobody believed Quincy's theory,
okay?

19
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,067
- Hey. I'm gonna be on TV.
Hey.

20
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,610
- No way.
Yeah.

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,447
They're putting together this panel to talk
about these fossils they found in Peru.

22
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,199
The Discovery Channel's gonna film it.

23
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,161
Oh, my God. Heh.
Who's gonna watch that?

24
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,289
- Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.

25
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,667
Ahem, I saw a girl with that vest.

26
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,210
Thanks.

27
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,758
- Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

28
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,845
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,140
Unfortunately, the sad fact remains...

30
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,226
...that most of these little guys
won't live to see the Fourth of July.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,646
Because as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

32
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,065
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

33
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,609
Because I was watching this,
uh, commercial on TV...

34
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,404
...and, man, those things are cute.

35
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,241
- Hi.
Hi.

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,661
Oh, Pete, you're back.
Hey, check this out.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,621
Wow. Skates. Ha, ha.

38
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,206
Whoa.

39
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:52,462
Wow. You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
So how was your trip?

41
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,633
- Well...
- Oh, what did you bring me?

42
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,305
Aw, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh.

43
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,515
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

44
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,143
- You want some coffee?
- Sure, that'd be great.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,311
Okay.

46
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,274
- Regular or decaf?
Ha, ha.

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,194
- Uh, whichever's closest.
All right.

48
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,029
- Okay.
- So ask me what I did today.

49
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,488
So, what did you do today, Pete?

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,158
I bought a restaurant,
and I would like you to be the chef.

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,993
What? Oh.

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,334
Can you believe
he just offered me a restaurant?

53
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,545
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

54
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,341
I mean, this has been my dream
since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

55
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,135
...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

56
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,520
I mean, I would kill for this job.
I mean, I can totally do this job...

57
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,983
...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.

58
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,570
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

59
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,574
- And you're still not attracted to him at all?
- Mm. No.

60
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,494
I mean, how could I accept a restaurant
from him? I can't.

61
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,872
I couldn't even accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,043
Yeah, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

63
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,170
- Ow.
- What, honey?

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,799
Ow, my side still hurts
from when you crashed into me yesterday.

65
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,717
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- I know. Ow.

66
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,511
Oh, God.

67
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,722
- Hey, you guys. Guess what.
Hey.

68
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,270
Got a job on a riverboat?

69
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,525
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

70
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,902
Guess what. You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

71
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,571
- Oh, I see. So this suit is making a point.
Mm.

72
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,908
Now that you're on your own,
you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.

73
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,703
You like it, right?

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,248
Absolutely. I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,376
Huh. Ross, Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.

76
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,546
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?

77
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,797
Okay, goodbye.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,926
So, um, after you put the suggestion
in the box...

79
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,595
...how long did it take
for the roller-skating thing to happen?

80
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,472
Um, about three months.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,392
Okay, so I guess that's about,
uh, two weeks...

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,185
...before the topless thing kicks in.

83
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,773
- Hey.
Hey.

84
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,486
I got you something. Open it. Open it.

85
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,031
Okay.

86
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,078
It's a chicken.

87
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,664
It's cute, huh?

88
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys,
do you know anything about chicks?

89
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,836
Fowl? No.

90
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,839
Women? No.

91
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,800
Okay, well,
they are a huge responsibility.

92
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,970
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

93
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,057
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

94
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,518
Oh, well, no problem there.

95
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,566
Easy, Lenny.

96
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,407
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

97
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,950
Okay, here's the thing.

98
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,995
Oh, no. Not "the thing. "
I hate "the thing. "

99
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,455
What's "the thing"?

100
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,458
I can't do it.

101
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,463
...but, um, see,
you have these feelings for me.

103
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,007
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what you're worried about?

104
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,926
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

105
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,677
- Huh?
- No.

106
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,681
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else, on my trip.

107
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,058
Oh?

108
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,144
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
Uh, we met on the plane.

109
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,146
She asked me if she could
finish off my peanuts.

110
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,024
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

111
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,113
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,827
Oh, that's great. I mean,
I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.

113
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,037
- And now I can work for you.
- I guess you can.

114
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,625
Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.

115
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,921
All right. You know what? I'm just gonna
roll right into that office and quit.

116
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,714
- All right.
- Okay.

117
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,300
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,637
- Good luck.
I'm quitting. Woo-hoo!

119
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,476
I'm okay. I'm all right.

120
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,567
Wow. That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

121
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,527
What?

122
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:29,531
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

123
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,701
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

124
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,954
So you told her there's somebody else
so she'd agree to work with you.

125
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,374
Because you figure, if you spend time
together, maybe something might happen.

126
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,878
You're good. You're good.

127
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,673
Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive.
And psychic.

128
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,134
It's a substantial gift.

129
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,054
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her, though?

130
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,975
Absolutely. Oh, I promise. Tell her what?

131
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,269
Thanks a lot.

132
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,230
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive,
but my memory sucks.

133
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,568
Okay, but this is the last time.

134
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,155
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

135
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,074
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

136
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,701
Chicken

137
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,246
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,290
How's she doing?

139
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,875
She?

140
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,919
Well, yeah. Don't you think it's a she?

141
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,254
I don't know.

142
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,892
I can't tell. Whatever it was,
went back in too quickly.

143
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,438
Anyway, I gotta change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

144
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,898
Excuse me?

145
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,566
What?

146
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,860
I stayed home from work
while you were at rehearsal...

147
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,571
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

148
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,034
Hey. Who was up from 2:00 this morning
until 5:00 this morning...

149
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,161
...trying to get her back to sleep?

150
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,664
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

151
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,083
Oh, here it comes.

152
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,795
Yes. Here it comes.
I'm stuck here all day.

153
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,131
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us...

154
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,387
...and then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

155
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,514
Well, I don't think so, mister.

156
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:22,310
Hey. I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

157
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,647
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

158
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,944
That's not what I said.
Okay, I just meant...

159
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,613
I know what you meant.

160
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,622
Did you notice that ever since
we got this chick...

161
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,126
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

162
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,047
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready
to have a chick.

163
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,302
I'll take her back tomorrow.

164
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,012
You think we'll get our 3 bucks back?

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,682
- Hey.
Hey.

166
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,975
Oh. Hey.

167
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,937
Listen, I have that TV thing in,
like, two hours, and I need your help.

168
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,691
Okay, what do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

169
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,736
Well, the brown one
brings out your eyes.

170
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,988
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

171
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,658
Really?

172
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,163
Ow.

173
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,467
Wow. That aspirin dance really works.

174
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,429
Ow.
- Oh, my God. Is that still?

175
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,889
I'm fine. I'm fine.

176
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,557
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

177
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,017
- Rach.
- Look, I'm fine.

178
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,436
Watch. Look at that. Uh-oh.

179
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,523
Okay, okay. Look, you've got
to go to a doctor, okay?

180
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,818
No, I have to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

181
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,154
Very big deal. There's people there
that I have to meet.

182
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,449
Yeah, and I'm sure you're gonna make
a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

183
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,493
It's nice to meet you. "

184
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,537
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

185
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,166
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

186
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,543
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

187
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,796
- Rachel.
- Look, either help me or go.

188
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,714
Fine. I'll go.

189
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,468
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

190
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,432
Sure. I'll help you.

191
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,267
Oh, good. Good.

192
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,770
Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

193
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,617
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

194
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,328
Would you please help me
with this too?

195
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,422
- Okay. Let's use this brush.
- Okay.

196
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,632
- This stuff? All right.
- Yeah. Careful.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,219
Light. Okay, you know,
just sweep it across the lid.

198
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,596
- Okay, just sweep it.
- Okey-dokey.

199
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,348
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry.

200
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,308
- Ha, ha. That's poking me in the eye.
- Ha, ha.

201
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,018
I'm sorry. Close, close, close.

202
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,562
- Okay, just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,440
- Right.
- Sweep, sweep...

204
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,525
Okay, now make it even,
because we don't...

205
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,444
- What?
- We don't want it...

206
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,821
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

207
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,323
You know,
you don't wear enough of this.

208
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,498
Since when...? Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

209
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,919
Well, I... Close your eye. I just think
you're gonna like this better because...

210
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,838
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

211
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,256
Sorry.

212
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,843
Because, um, I think this will make you
a little more sophisticated.

213
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,720
Sophisticated like a hooker?

214
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,558
- Hey.
- Hey.

215
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,393
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

216
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,562
I'm checking out the restaurant
with Pete.

217
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,232
- Oh. Monica, I am so excited for you.
- I know.

218
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,942
Ooh, I have to tell you something.

219
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,820
- What?
- Well, I can't tell you.

220
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,034
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell
me something that you could tell me?

221
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,328
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

222
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,917
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to, like, all my gods.

223
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,920
Okay.

224
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,922
Does it have to do
with Ross and Rachel?

225
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,256
No.

226
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,509
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

227
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,262
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock that he keeps by his bed?

228
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,433
No, but let's come back to that later.

229
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:38,191
There you go.
Good enough for your party? Huh?

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,074
Sure.

231
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:50,578
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from Purchasing.

232
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,957
Come on.

233
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:58,586
Okay, come on. All right, I gotta go.
So good luck at the party, okay?

234
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,548
Oh, wait, Ross. Could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

235
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,468
Sure. Okay.

236
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,764
Okay. Okay, great.
Um, okay, just turn around.

237
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,767
- What?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

238
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,438
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.

239
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,817
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

240
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,946
Yeah, but that was different, you know?
We were going out then.

241
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,739
Now it's weird.

242
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,535
Rach, you know,
I can see you naked anytime I want.

243
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,620
- What?
- Ha, ha.

244
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,834
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See? Woo-hoo.

245
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,548
- Ross, stop that.
- I'm sorry.

246
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,634
Come on. I don't want you
thinking of me like that anymore.

247
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,761
Uh, sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

248
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,472
It's one of my, uh, rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

249
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,892
Huh? Oh. Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,979
- Stop it. Cut it out. Cut it out.
- Okay, okay.

251
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,315
I'm sorry. It will never happen... Uh-oh.

252
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,025
Wait a minute. Wait, wait...

253
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,403
Now there are a hundred of you,
and I'm the king.

254
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,448
- Ross...
- Oh, come on.

255
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,992
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

256
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,996
All right. Fine.

257
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,373
- Yowza.
- Okay.

258
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,419
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

259
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,379
- Okay, that's it. Ow!
- Oh, come on.

260
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,174
Oh, my God. All right, look, look, okay.

261
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,345
Rach. Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

262
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,472
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay.

263
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,141
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

264
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,185
Oh, wait, wait,
you're not gonna come with me?

265
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,941
Of course I am.

266
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,109
Uh, I just have to make a call.

267
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,402
- Okay.
- Okay?

268
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,446
Thank you.

269
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,368
Ow!

270
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,661
What's wrong?

271
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,498
I'm sorry. I just can't go to the hospital
looking like this.

272
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,876
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

273
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,379
Does it involve clogs?

274
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,090
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

275
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,050
- Clogs.
- No.

276
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,718
- Claws?
- No.

277
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,392
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel
or Chandler or Joey.

278
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,936
- What about Pete?
- No.

279
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,854
What is it?

280
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,316
- What about Pete?
- I don't know.

281
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,319
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

282
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,950
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't.

283
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,120
- Okay, you know, I gotta go.
- But you're so close. No.

284
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,247
Something to do
with Pete's company?

285
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,999
Ugh. Just go. You're never gonna get it.

286
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,260
I know.

287
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,847
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

288
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,850
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

289
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,814
I love you both.

290
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,484
But in very different ways.

291
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,406
Ooh. Ah.

293
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,325
What are you doing?
I though you were gonna take her back.

294
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,578
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

295
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,123
So then I took her to the shelter.
And you know what I found out?

296
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,507
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her.

297
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,135
And I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

298
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,805
Okay, good, good, good.

299
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,391
Because I was kind of having
second thoughts too.

300
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,479
Okay. And it's not just chicks, you know?
It's all kinds of other animals.

301
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,315
That's horrible.
Well, you did the right thing, man.

302
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,442
Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.

303
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,581
Oh, funny story.

304
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,169
I don't believe this.

305
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,923
Wow, look at this refrigerator.
It's gigantic.

306
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,885
I mean, I could live in this thing.
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold.

307
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,099
Oh, my God. Look at these spider burners.
I love spider burners.

308
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,517
So you like it?

309
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,938
Oh, it is so perfect. Thank you so much.

310
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,315
- You're welcome.
- Oh.

311
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,572
Did you just smell my hair?

312
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,201
No. No way. What? No.

313
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,954
- Oh, God.
- What?

314
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,249
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

315
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,336
No. I'm just excited about the restaurant,
that's all.

316
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,755
- Pete?
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

317
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,969
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all.

318
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,220
It's really nice.

319
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,516
Look, the only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

320
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,352
Yeah, you may be okay
with getting hurt...

321
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,730
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

322
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,777
- That's why I can't take this job.
- What?

323
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,698
Well, we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

324
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,075
I'm sorry.

325
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,452
Okay. Yeah.

326
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,790
I mean, if that's really what you want,
okay.

327
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,587
Okay. Bye.

328
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,468
I'm sorry things didn't work out...

329
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,931
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

330
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,938
Oh, wow.

331
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,280
Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?

332
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,201
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

333
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:09,248
Hey, now, you stay out here
and you think about what you did.

334
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,628
- That's a duck.
- That's a bad duck.

335
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,218
- How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
- Oh, it was... No, no.

336
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,469
What thing? What thing?

337
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,263
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

338
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,557
Easy.

339
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,518
Okay, now, when you come back...

340
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,480
...I hope you remember
that that chick is not a toy.

341
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,277
What thing? What is this thing?

342
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:43,157
Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

343
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,660
Oh, my God.

344
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,578
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

345
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,539
Ah, I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

346
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,835
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

347
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,213
- Come on.
- I cannot believe you.

348
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,967
- What?
- That is the sweetest thing.

349
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,062
You should get some sleep.

350
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,147
Okay.

351
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,775
- So I'll, um...
- I'm sorry I spoiled your evening.

352
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,361
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.

353
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,489
So I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

354
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,449
Mm-hm. Yeah.

355
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,874
See you.

356
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,930
What did you do?

357
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,525
What you doing?

358
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,736
Having a swim.

359
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,904
What about the chick?

360
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,906
Chicks don't swim.

361
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,700
Are you sure?

362
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,078
I don't know.

363
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,915
- Should we try?
- Sure.

364
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,800
See, I told you. They don't swim.

365
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,304
- Well, give him a minute.
- No.

366
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,059
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
