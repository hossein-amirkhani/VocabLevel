1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,796
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,716
"Say, Rachel...

3
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:11,719
...I was wondering if you'd like to go
to a movie with me sometime...

4
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,512
...as my lover. "

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,142
Mm. Too out there.

6
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,103
"Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime...

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,480
...as my lover. "

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,609
- Hi.
- Hi.

9
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,528
All right, let's go shopping.

10
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,406
You know, before we go, uh,
there's something I need to say.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,908
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,622
I've kind of had this, uh...
This crush on you.

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,668
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,797
Now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,343
So that's what I'm doing now.

16
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,931
Wow. Um...

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,360
I dropped a cup.

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,914
So that's why within a few years,
that voice recognition...

19
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,250
...is gonna be pretty much standard
on any computer.

20
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,130
You know, so you could be, like,
"Wash my car. Clean my room. "

21
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,382
It's not gonna be able to do
any of those things...

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,467
...but it'll understand
what you're saying.

23
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,055
- Oh, this was so great.
- Yeah, it was.

24
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,808
All right, then.

25
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,394
Bye.

26
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,694
Hello, people who do not live here.

27
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,946
Hi.
- Hello.

28
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,325
I gave you a key for emergencies.

29
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,578
We were out of Doritos.

30
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,957
Hey, how'd the date go
with Mr. Millionaire?

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,210
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.

32
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,130
Third wife sold separately. "

33
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,842
He's great. I mean,
we have such a good time together.

34
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,097
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all.

35
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,308
- Still?
No.

36
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,270
It's driving me crazy. I mean, in every
other way, he's like the perfect guy.

37
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:12,357
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

38
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,278
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper Image?

39
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,821
Two.

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,574
Wow. Can Joey and I
put them on and fight?

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:31,793
Oh, Mommy. Oh, Daddy.
I am a big old baddy.

42
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,091
I guess he must've gotten the part
in that play.

43
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,220
- Oh.
- Either that or Gloria Estefan was right.

44
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,805
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

45
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,272
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.

46
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,612
- Hey.
- Hi.

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,073
Ah, so you're playing Adrianne, huh?

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,784
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

49
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,665
No, no. Uh, I'm playing your husband,
Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

50
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,042
Hi. Nice to meet you. Kate Miller.

51
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,593
Heh. So the, uh, play's pretty great, huh?

52
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,346
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

53
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,764
She's so brilliantly incisive...

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,642
...when it comes to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

55
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,853
Oh, forget about it. She rocks. Ha, ha.

56
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,860
Where do I know you from?

57
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,531
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

58
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,158
Days of our Lives?

59
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,078
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by Teen Beat?

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,290
No, that's not it.

61
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,834
So you're a soap actor.

62
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,296
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play. Hmm?

63
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,299
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

64
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,843
That infomercial.

65
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,014
For the milk-carton-spout thing.

66
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,933
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk.

67
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,896
See, I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.

68
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,566
Ha, ha. Now, see, that's acting.

69
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,069
Right. At the end, you choked
on a cookie.

70
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,946
Yeah, that was real.

71
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,993
- Wow. I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.

72
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,953
Well, So, what are you gonna tell him?

73
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,166
Well, I told him I would think about it,
but I'm gonna tell him no.

74
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,625
Huh.

75
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,421
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

76
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,677
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there...

77
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:50,098
...with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him...

78
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,017
...which I'm allowed to do...

79
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,480
...and I felt guilty, you know,
like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

80
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,192
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...

81
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,321
...that you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

82
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,120
- I don't have any issues with my father.
- Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.

83
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,416
I hate this woman. I hate her.

84
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,211
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial...

85
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,464
...and now they all keep asking me
to open their drinks.

86
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:27,010
Okay? And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me.

87
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,307
- Hello.
Hey.

88
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,434
So Rachel called.

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,145
Wants to see me.

90
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,023
Going over in a minute.

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,070
- Wow. What do you think she wants?
- Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted...

92
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,490
...and she realizes that life without me...

93
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,658
...sucks.

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,831
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

95
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,667
Just trying to be supportive.

96
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,670
Well, be supportive like a guy.

97
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,048
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

98
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,513
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,725
You, uh, wanted to see me?

100
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,855
Yeah.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,442
Uh, here's a box of your stuff.

102
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,614
- What?
- Uh, it's just like hats and a shirt and CD's.

103
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,033
Just sort of stuff that you've left here.

104
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,287
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

105
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,747
No.

106
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,292
Ross.

107
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:45,547
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

108
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,215
I mean, don't you think?

109
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,635
- Yes.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,387
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

111
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,639
Yeah, I really do.

112
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,559
Hey...

113
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,479
This was a gift.

114
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,648
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

115
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,775
It's still a gift.

116
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,487
I got it from the gift shop.

117
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,365
Okay. All right. Give me the mug.
I'll keep the mug.

118
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,620
No. You know, don't do me any favors.
In fact, where...

119
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,166
Where's the rest of my stuff? Huh?
Like my, um...

120
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,669
Hey. This book is mine.

121
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:31,092
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

122
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,432
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.

123
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,727
I'm just trying to help you move on.

124
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh, you are a petty man.

125
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,274
You are a petty, petty...

126
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,901
- Petty...
... petty, petty...

127
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,361
...small...
... small...

128
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,575
You are so just doing this
out of spite.

129
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,577
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

130
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,872
I'm gonna wear this all the time.
I love this shirt.

131
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:05,418
You haven't worn that since you were 15.
It doesn't even fit you anymore.

132
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,963
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

133
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,549
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

134
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,313
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...

135
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,857
...and relax...

136
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,944
...in my favorite shirt.

137
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,031
You have a pleasant evening.

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,626
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

139
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,755
And you're our age. You're our age.

140
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,009
You know what?
You should, like, buy a state...

141
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,553
...and then just name it after yourself.

142
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,513
What, like, "Pete Dakota"?

143
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,850
Or "Mississi-Pete. "

144
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,688
Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

145
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,275
That's not a state, Joe.

146
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,111
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

147
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,533
I gotta go, so, uh,
I'll see you guys later.

148
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,036
- Okay. You're our age.
- Okay.

149
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,956
So, uh, are we on for tomorrow?

150
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,791
Absolutely.

151
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,670
Now get out of here, you.

152
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,804
Okay, I'm running out of places
I can touch him.

153
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,057
Is there something wrong with me?

154
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,018
I mean, why am I only attracted to guys
where there's no future?

155
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,812
Either they're too old
or they're too young.

156
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,148
And there's Pete,
who's crazy about me...

157
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,735
...and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on.

158
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,279
Seriously. Does it sound like
something's wrong with me?

159
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,239
Yeah, kind of.

160
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,912
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

161
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,455
Happy?

162
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,208
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be? Huh?

163
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,835
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

164
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,421
I talk to you, and nothing.

165
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,049
You look at me, and it's nothing.

166
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,428
Nothing.

167
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,182
Tasty.

168
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,021
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

169
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,524
- I have a question about this scene.
Yes.

170
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,112
Well, I don't understand
why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

171
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,781
Peel the onion.

172
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,200
First of all, he's good-looking.

173
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,743
Yeah.

174
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,955
I think my character is gonna need
a bit more of a reason than that.

175
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,375
Oh, hey, how about this one?
Uh, it says so in the script.

176
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,297
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

177
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,467
I mean, it says in the script here
that you're a bitch.

178
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,929
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.

179
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,310
I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it.
It doesn't matter.

180
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,313
I still wind up with this
little cowlick-y thing...

181
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,067
...on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.

182
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,236
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.

183
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,502
Is there any chance you didn't see that?

184
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,216
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

185
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,344
You can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

186
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,682
You're gonna get peep-eye.

187
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,686
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

188
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,022
She'd say no, but here we are, right?

189
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,649
We just broke up,
first thing she does.

190
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,401
You didn't just break up.

191
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,528
Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.

192
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,073
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

193
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,243
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

194
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,747
Here they come. Here they... Oh.

195
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,666
If she kisses him good night,
I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

196
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,877
I can't watch.

197
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,671
Come on. Date over. Date over.

198
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,217
- Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.

199
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,094
She's going in. Ha, ha.
Wait. He's going in.

200
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,556
He's going in.

201
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,560
The door's closed. I can't see
anything with the door closed.

202
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,564
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

203
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,442
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it.

204
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,194
- Stop what?
- I don't know.

205
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,405
But I have a feeling
that my being there will do it.

206
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,158
I'll go over and I will borrow something.

207
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,077
- Juice. I need juice.
- No.

208
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,578
- You can't.
- A little help.

209
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,581
- They must be stopped.
- I am your friend...

210
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,792
...and I am not gonna let you do this.

211
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,503
You are surprisingly strong.

212
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,757
- I need juice. People need juice.
- Look, man...

213
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,844
- People need juice. Juice. They need...
- Listen to me.

214
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,977
She's moving on, okay? If it's not
this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

215
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,479
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole...

216
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:20,650
...you are gonna have to get used
to the fact that the relationship is over.

217
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,070
Okay, man? It's over.

218
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,243
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

219
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,954
It's just I miss her so much.

220
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,665
I know.

221
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,378
Why do all your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

222
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,423
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

223
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,385
That way, if one of them is missing,
she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

224
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,520
You know what?

225
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,315
No, and I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

226
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,858
I can't do this.

227
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,569
Yep. Yep.
That's what I didn't want to know.

228
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,406
Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

229
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,117
I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

230
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,495
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

231
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,625
Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?

232
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,711
Look, you wanna get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

233
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,422
Really.

234
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,594
No, no. I say we get back at him right here
on this couch. Right here.

235
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,473
Oh, my God.

236
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,392
I'm sorry about this.

237
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,479
That's okay.

238
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,691
- You sure?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,488
I can just go home
and get back at him by myself.

240
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,119
And should become
the penicillin of the 21 st century.

241
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,290
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps...

242
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,168
...toward leading that revolution.

243
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,380
- It is truly ironic.
- Hey. Can I ask you something?

244
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,093
Where are we?

245
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,430
Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

246
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,599
...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.

247
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,060
Just tell me the truth.

248
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,896
Okay.

249
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,484
Um, you know, I don't think
I told you this...

250
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,905
...but, um, I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

251
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,408
Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?

252
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,120
So I did tell you.

253
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,956
Okay, well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

254
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,084
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life...

255
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,712
...where I just need to focus on me.
- Mm.

256
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,797
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I know.

257
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,429
- I so want to be attracted to you.
- But you're not. Okay. Good.

258
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,347
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,102
You know what? Don't be.
This is not...

260
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,396
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

261
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,775
- It's not?
- Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

262
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,613
Or someone you find attractive.

263
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,825
I just think, you know...

264
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,579
...that you might end up
feeling differently.

265
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,917
Well, look, I don't want this
to come out wrong...

266
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:30,173
...but, uh, you seem awfully confident
for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.

267
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,842
Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?

268
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,679
Uh, listen. Let's...
You wanna get something to eat?

269
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,182
Because this place is kind of depressing.

270
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,229
Now the man who made
this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

271
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,939
One second.

272
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:59,368
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

273
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,082
Draw.

274
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,295
I wasn't doing anything.

275
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,262
Uh-oh. What did she do now?

276
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:23,309
Just because she went to Yale Drama,
she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...

277
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,187
...since sliced bread.

278
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,899
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

279
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,362
God, I just... I hate her. I hate her
with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...

280
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,449
...and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good. "

281
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,828
I think somebody has a crush
on somebody.

282
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,872
Hey, Chandler, can we please try
and stay focused on my problem here?

283
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,082
You know?

284
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,669
I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.

285
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,256
Oh.

286
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,842
Oh. You're out of your mind.

287
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,761
Hey, you've done nothing
but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

288
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,221
If you were in school yard...

289
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,683
...you'd be pulling her pigtails
and pushing her down now.

290
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,352
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I keep thinking about her...

291
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,355
...in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff, huh?

292
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,866
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

293
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,994
Well, why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

294
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,580
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

295
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,207
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

296
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,085
You look at me, and nothing.

297
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,308
Nothing.

298
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:51,564
You guys make me fly.

299
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,942
High.

300
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,946
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here
tomorrow.

301
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,618
- Well, that was, uh...
- Better?

302
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,163
Yeah, yeah, it was definitely...

303
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,040
...an improvement.

304
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,292
- Good night.
Uh, Kate.

305
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,793
Yeah?

306
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,671
You, uh... You forgot your shoes.

307
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,801
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

308
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,350
- Okay.
- Hey, listen...

309
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,478
...you, uh, feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

310
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,064
- Um... Yo.
- Kate.

311
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,149
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

312
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,904
Very nice. Very nice.

313
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,366
So, um...

314
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,369
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

315
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,037
- Right.
- Good night.

316
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,340
Hey.

317
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,552
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

318
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,596
You know, like Goldman, Silverman?

319
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,808
Because it's not his last name.

320
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,186
- It isn't?
- No, it's not, like...

321
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,021
Like Phil Spiderman.

322
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,442
He's a spider...

323
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,152
...man.

324
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:24,407
You know, like, uh...
Like Goldman is a last name.

325
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,909
But there's no gold man.

326
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,370
Oh, okay.

327
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,205
There should be a Gold Man.

328
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,418
- Hey.
Hey, Rach.

329
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,211
- How was work?
- Oh, great.

330
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,381
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

331
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,718
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

332
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,221
Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

333
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,392
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...

334
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,145
Something wrong?

335
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,239
Hmm. No. Nothing.

336
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,791
So, uh, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

337
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,212
Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

338
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,925
- What about things that are already gold?
- Ah. His work is done.

339
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,845
Okay, let's play my game.

340
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,096
Okay.

341
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,975
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered...

342
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,477
Draw.

343
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,773
Yeah, it's fun.
